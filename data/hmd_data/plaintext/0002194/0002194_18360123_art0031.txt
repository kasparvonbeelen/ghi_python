alth'iugh the Government, and all whom it can influ-
en ,!e be included among that mischievous and degraded
vtass of persons. Ttn2 Successful prMeedings in the
county of Tipperary_ show what may be done by men
who act with tl',e energy and determination which
ought to belong to those whose interest and 'duty it is
to maintain. the rights of property and to upheld the au-
thority of the law. The two members for that county.
both zraloos supporters of Ministers are both avowed
paramrs in that gigantic and abominable conspiracy,
yr-111th has grown to its present magnitude untler
tial patronage, and the visible purpose of which is to
place all property and all law under the capricious and
despotic dominion of brute force ; to elevate the Popish
fnests of Ireland, and their infatuated aHd misguided
ollowers, to the place of absolute Legislators in that
country ; and to prostrate aliko the Sovereign anti the
Parliament of the United Kingdom, together with all
'who deem that either is entitled to respect and obe-
dience, at the feet of the fierce, barbarous, and insolent
conspirators. One of these Representatives of an
Irish county has just been taught that his adherence,
howe-ier faithful, to the Melbourne-O'Connell Go-
verr.ment, that his alliance, however close, with the
re Ober priesthood, that the protection, however zealous •
and vigilant, which he hoped to derive from the prompt
alacrity of his Popish tenantry, at the instigation of
their spiritual Instructors, to shed the blood of the'
agents and friends of" British law—that all those de-
fences and securities are not sufficient to enable him,
with impunity, to trample upon the rights of property,
to withstand the just and legal claims of the Protestant
Church, and to defy the authority 'of that Legislature.
which, as one of its Members, it is his especial duty to
maintain and uphold. What has been effected in the
case of R. Otway Cave, Esq., M.P. for the county of Tip-
perary, and devoted friend of Lord Melbourne's.'
Government, may be equally effected in the case of
every other
.member of tlit anti-tithe conspiracy, and
this not only without the sanction, but in contemp-,
tuous defiance, of an Administration which exists only
as the patron, kn d must expire whenever it shall cease
to be the Tc,atron, of the wicked and lawless confede-
rates. `sae recommend the manly and spirited example
of M. Philip Ryan to the imitation of every man in
Ire:land whose duty it is to protect and secure that de-
scription of property against which the felon, conspiracy
is directed. The Government dare not, even to gratify
Mr. O'Conriell and the rest of the conspirators, shut
the doors of the Irish Court of Exchequer. That Court
has manifested a just determination not to permit its
writs to be cuntemptuously treated. The public force
must, when necessary, assist in the execution of
such writs. This assistance neither Lord Mul-
grave -nor Lord Morpeth has ventured, or will ven-
ture, to deny ; for neither of their Lordships has,
we believe, the least inclination to take his repose
-within the walls of one of his Majesty's gaols. Let
the tithe collectors universally adopt the Prucient
course which Mr. Ryan has found so efficacious.
Let them obtain Exchequer processes against each of
the more important conspirators ,if their district, and,
when an adequate force of m:,titary and police to pro-
tect the execution of that -process has -been collected,
let them avail themselves of the safe and convenient
opportunity afforded Toy the proximity and state of pre-
paration of that force to execute the more summary
process of distkaint upon the smaller fry of the robber
confederacy. The King's Government say that the
public force shall not protect the summary process of
distraint until the agents of the law, unprotected, have
first exposed themselves to the danger, or rather to the
certainty, of murder. The King's Courts, however,
are not so hostile to the rights of property, or so in-
different to the safety of human life. They insist.,
and can fortunately insist with effect, that their writs
shall not remain without execution for want of an
adequate display of the public force, until the op-
portunity of :bloodshed has been afforded and the
risk of it encountered. The high Courts of law
are not in the anti-tithe conspiracy, and to them
it seems ',hat the probability of murder is ground
enough for preventive precautions. Here is a
resource, of which the active and intelligent tithe agent
in the county of Tipperary has very properly availed
himself, to overpower at once the contumacy of Mr.
Otway Cave and that of the inferior herd of conspi-
rators, who probably thought themselves secure in imi-
tating his example, and in relying upon his influence
with a dependent Government for their protection.. We
will repeat here the brief and satisfactory statement of
the Tipperary Constitution, for we take the fact it
discloses to be of infinite value in the present state of
Ireland :

" NENAGII, Jan. 16.—This Morning, at ten o'clock, a
company of the 27th Regiment and a body of police, ac-
companied by the Sheriff and Mr. Philip Ryan, tithe-
agent, proceeded to the residence of Robert Otws.ly Cave,
Esq. On reaching the house, Mr. Ryan dismounted, and
posted on the hall door six notices ; when returning, M.
Ryan distrained several persons, most of whom settled."
Mr. Ryan had previously memorialised the Govern-
ment very urgently for aid to enable him to distrain
with safety, and had received from Mr. Drummond
the same answer which Lord Morpeth had repeatedly
given under his own hand to similar applications=-an
answer to which we do no more than justice when we
characterise it as in the last degree brutal and insulting
—informing him in effect that he should have no aid
or protection until. he had first exposed himself or his
assistants to the imminent risk of murder. The au-
thority of the Court of Exchquer, however, gave to
this Gentleman substantially what the Government
had refused. We recommend again and again the
judicious tactics of this spirited and intelligent agent
to the imitation of who are engaged in the discharge
of similar duties, If its means and powers are pro-
perly drawn out and applied, the law will prevail in
spite of the Government. And what a magnificent
and glorious spectacle for the nation ! How eminently
conducive to its future and permanent peace, welfare,
and happiness, will be the final and complete triumph
of the law and its august tribunals over a wicked and
unprincipled conspiracy, in defiance of a Government
so weak and so corrupt as to have allowed these con-
spirators to influence its Councils in subserviency to
their lawless objects, and to fetter all its powers in ab-
ject slavery to their sovereign will.—Morning Post.

POLICE INTELLIGENCE.

MANSION-HOUSE.

A woman named Mary Ann Murphy, who has been
long famous for breaking windows with her fists, was
brought, before the Lord Mayor, charged with having giver.
a publican a treat of the kind because he rek,sed to SP,pply
her with gin gratis, and ordered to be COrdifilLLOtt ;:t1 default
of bail, to keep the peace. As the officer Was taking her
LO the Compter, she made a stanr!, opposite to the win-
dow of a shopkeeper in Newgatc,street and hit the glass
-nett and left in so scientific at manner, that the two panes
dropped in- pieces, leaving 'ate frames quite clear. " I can
do that," said S" wi':u.every b—v window in the whole
front, if you give tie fair play ;" when the officer pinioned
her. She then ar„pealed to the crowd fora rescue, but no-
body was gall An;, enough to release her from the arms
of the const able, who took her back to pay another visit
to his Lordship.
After being placed at the bar, she looked over at the
Lord Mayor and Mr. Hobler, leaning upon her elbows.
The Loan MAYOR—So yOU are determined to do all
the mischief you can ? Defendant—l an't a going to prison
for nothing. You don't think you're going to choke me
off, do yokiddy u ? If you do, I'm blowed if you an't in the wrong

the would I get money ? If I had, you don't think l'd

Hobler—You can get money to spend in gin, Mrs.
Murphy. We know your character here. Defendant—
Oh, you do, do you ? Why, then, I'm blessed if you shan't
know me better, for Pll shiver every h—y glaze I comes
across.

The LORD MAYOR (to the constable)—Does she not cut
her bands in this desperate sort of amusement? Constable
—Never, my Lord. She has acquired a knack from long
practice, and those whose windows she breaks for the first
time are afraid to appear against her, as they expect fre-
Trent visits if they do.
Defendant—l tell you I shan't go to prison for doing of
nothing. As we go long again I'll pitch into a few of your

Ail omnibus conductor, named William Rose, was
charged by a corporal in the second battalion of Grenadier
Guards, uader the following circumstances : -

The complainant stated that he got into an omnibus at
the corner of Whitcomb-street, having ascertained from the
conductor that he was going to the Bank, and being most
anxious to be at the Tower at nine o'clock ; and when the
omnibus got to Charing-cross the driver delayed beyond all
patience, and complainant heard the clock strike the hour
in question. He expostulated with the defendant, and 'en-
deavoured to get out, but the defendant abused him in a
most gross manner, pushed him back, and refused tuiain
him to leave the omnibus. •

A vntleman who was inside Confirmed this statement.
The Loan MAYO[ fine-,,a the conductor 51., and in de-
fault of payment snt him to Bridewell.

MARLBORO UGH-STREET.

Pc/ward Murphy, an ex-pugilist, send at present an om-
nibus driver, was charged with having committed a Vioknt
assault on a boot-maker, named Palmer.
Palmer, who appeared with his heat bound up, said he
was returning home, in company with two frienklN on Sun-
day night, and when near the Plough Public-house, Bond-
street, he stopped, and told the persons with him he would
have a partino• glass. The public-house being closed he
,
proceeded toolnock and while so doing the defendant, ac-
companktd by a number of other men, came up, and'Seized
him. by the back of his coat, and dashed him violently on
the pavement. The defendant then struck right and left
at his friends, and had not the police made their appear-
ance, they would have received very ill treatment. Com-
plainant had not done or said the least thing to provoke
the attack on him. His head was badly cut by the
and he had been obliged to have recourse to e. gurgeoa.
A young man who was with the complainant at the time
the assault was committed, said that he thought the com-
plainant Was killed, as the blood ran from his head so pro-
fusely.
The defendant alleged intoxication. He was desired to
go out and settle the matter with the plaintiff, but having
refused to give 2/. in satisfaction of the outrage, he was
again brought in and fined that .sum, or fourteen days'
imprisonment.

UNION-HALL.
SEVERE PENALTIES.—Ye-sterday four Irish women and
a man were charged with creating a nuisance in the parish
of Walworth, by placing their baskets on the footpath,
and selling their goods.
A constable under the Trustees of the Road said that
the defers ants were in the habit of exposing their goods
for .saie on the footpath, and that he seized the articles
-ttiey were selling, and also their baskets. He complained
that an attempt at rescue was made, after he had made the
seizure, and tiat be was pelted at by the defendants,—and
added, three of the defendants had been at the office a few
days since for a similar offence.
Mr. JEREMY said that he recollected the defendants
when they were brought there a few days ago, and on that
occasion the fines were not inflicted, in the hope the
nuisance would be abated. They, however, had taken ad-
vantage of the lenity extended to them, and again repeated
the offence. The Magistrate then told them that they
were liable to 40s. fine, and in default of payment impri-
sonment for three months. He should now fine them 5s
each, and costs, and if they did not pay it, they must go
for 14 days.

One of the women said that her only support was selling
fruit at Walworth ; she had two children depending upon
her for their bread, and they all must starve if she was not
to be allowed to sell a few things in the street. She said
that she Etood at the edge of the footpath and did not
impede the passengers, and Buchanan, the constable, seized
her as if she was one of the greatest offenders, tore the
basket and her fruit away from her, and tumbled the whole
of them into a cart, which he brought for the purpose.
Another of the defendants complained that her basket of
sprats was thrown into the gutter by the constable, and
that five starving children were waiting at home in the hope
of getting victuals by the produce of that which was all de-
stroyed in a moment by the constable.
The MAGISTRATE said that they had all been cautioned
and must suffer for their obstinacy.
One defendant asked if she would be permitted to go
about with her basket slung before her to sell her goods?
Mr. TRAII-,L said that even that would be an infringe-
ment of the law, for which she would be liable to have her
goods seized.

- Three of the defendants were then fined mitigated pe-
nalties, and havinc, no goods to levy a distress upon suffi-
cient to cover the fines, they were sentenced to fourteen
days' imprisonment. Their baskets and the remnant of their
little stock remain in the hands of the constable.
The defendants all exclaimed against the decision ; one
of the women crying out " what are my children to do while
I am in gaol ; there are two of them now in the office, and
nobody to take care of them if they are separated from me."
They were then locked up.
An old man, residing in Maypole-alley, near this office,
complained that a fine little baby had been left at his house
by the mother, who absconded ; and that he did not know
what to do with it.

The Magistrate inquired if the child had any claim upon
him ? Applicant—None at all, Sir. I'm an ould man ;
and have no one but my ould woman at home. The mo-
ther of the child placed it at the door, and I had not the
heart to shut it against it. He then said he was wretchedly
poor, and that it was as much as he could do to get a morsel
for him and his wife.

The MAGISTRATE having narrowly questioned him with
a view to ascertain if the unnatural mother could be found,
and eliciting that the applicant was ignorant as to who she
was, directed him to take the child to the parish officers,
and state to them the circumstances under which it was
abandoned.

The applicant said that he called on the overseers, but
they would have nothing to do with the child. He, how-
ever, was desired to call again at the workhouse, and if
something was not done, a summons would be granted to
him.

LAMBETH-STREET.
YesterdA:( two person% of respectable appearance, named
Mott and Scale, Who have for some years held responsi•
We and lucrative situations in his Majesty's Customs, were
placed within the bar, before J. HARDWICK, Esq., and
charged with being concerned with Jourdan, alias Leary,
Sullivan, and Huey, in the extensive robbery at the Cus-
tom-house, in the month of November, 1834.
Mr. Walford, the solicitor, and Mr. Thackerv, the as-
sistant-solicitor, of the Board of Customs, and Mr. Holder
attended for the prosecution; Mr. Fitzpatrick, a solicitor,
and Mr. Jones, the barrister, appeared on behalf of the
prisoners.

Mr. lirAder stated that from information which had
been communicated to him he had every reason to think
tkA the prisoners Were engaged, with other persons at
present in etuitOdy, in committing an extensive robbery at
the Custom-hotfse, in the month of November, 1834 ; and
he had therefore to request the Magistrate would remand
them until Wednesday next, when the other prisoners would'
be brought up, and he, Mr. Hobler, would produce such
testimony as would connect them with the other prisoners
in the offence.

Mr. Jones hoped that before the Magistrates consented
to the request of Mr. Hobler he would require that some-
thing would be stated as a ground for remandinr, the priso-
ners, particularly as they were persons who had, up to the
present, sustained the most unblemished characters, and to
whom character was of the first importance. The fact of
their being remanded would of itself create in the minds of
their friends and the public a serious impression against
them, and he therefore hoped they would not be detained
upon slight or speiulative grounds. Under these circum-
stances, he (Mr. Jones) hoped his Worship would re-
quire further and better grounds for remanding his clients
than that which Mr. Hobler stated, namely, that he thought
he would, if the prisoners were remanded, be able to con-
nect them in some way or other with the robbery.
Mr. HARDWICKE replied that the ends of justice were
in many cases defeated by the publication of the evidence in
the first instance, and therefore he did not feel bound to
comply with the request of Mr. Jones. In nine cases out
of ten the Magistrates in the first instance were obliged to
receive the assertion of their officers that they would be
able to produce further evidence against the prisoners on a
future day. if they were to act otherwise, public justice
would be often defeated.
Mr. HOBLER said that it was with much reluctance he
had come forward as a witness on the present occasion, and
he should not have done so but that information had reached
him with respect to the prisoners and their alleged connec-
tion with the robbery, which had not been communicated to
any of the officers. The prisoner Mott held a situation in
the Custom House under Mr. Billings, the principal ware-
house keeper, and was well acquainted with the ,particular
office from which the money had been stolen.. The other
prisoner held the situation of a landing waiter, and was the
intimate friend and associate of Witt, and on a future day
he would be able to show the close connection of both
.
previously, as well as subsequent to the robbery, with the
prisoners Jourdan and Sullivan.
Mr. Jones said that when he mentioned the word " Spe-
culation," he did not intend it as at all offensive towards Mr.
Hobler, as he knew that Gentleman too well to suppose t

that he would upon hi.ere speculation hate two persons
movinir',in the station:6'f socl'ety in Which the prisoners had
done to 'en int'o cuse6dy.
1-I.littAqcti ObserVcd that if such had been done
the person guilty Of it should nOt ~have escaped at least
the highest reprobatiOo. Orefore; upon
the aSsertit of Kr: I6hl.e'r., lie Wonta merely ask him if,
froth thl^ ltnorination he had received, he would be able,
on a future day, to bring forward some evidence to connect
the prisoners with the robbery ?

Mr. NOBLER replied in the afirmative► Mid It 0-499ers
were remanded until Wednesday next, when they will be
brought up with Jourdan, Sullivan, and Huey, for further
examination.

Mr. Jones applied to have the prisoners adrititted to
hail for their appearance on a future day, which was re-
fused by Mr. HARDWICK, who said that as tho la* at pre-
...met stood, he could not receive bail for .a twironer Wilde
under examination.

LARRUPING A SEAMAN.--.+7,:,,,,,i11ak
THAMES..OFFICE,
Switzer, the Cap-
tain of the Amy-'
...:rican ship Henry Leeds. and AlexAnder
-.weer, his brother, the chief Mitts! of the PAftit U&sel,
were brought'before Mr, LIALLANTINE and Mr. BRODE-
RIP, charged with assaulting Joseph Stephenson, a sailor on
board, who stated that on Sundaay afternoon, while he was
below in the forecastle shaving, he was called to wash
decks; lie Emig nut that he was shaving, and mild not,
and the captain and matt tatilU down, the former with a
thick rope; andlafrupped him over the head and Aboulders
until he Was as stiff as a belayinir vin, The sailor produced
the bight of a thick rope, with which he said the larruppirg
was inflicted.

Mrs t1101)talP asked the sailor why he could not wash
the decks when he was ordered? The Sailor—There was
no one to do it but me and a boys
Mr, BitobEntr—But why did you nut do it? The
Was nut a petior times it was churth.tittios
Mr. .11.1i.L.kriflic-,Did you take It tip as A Matter of
consiei&ite bftaikst It Was Sunday ?--iArhyi it IS Brit usual to
swnh decks at that time;

The Captain; in defensr..:ii it was freezing in the morn-
ing, and Viiithifig of the decks was postponed until the
dMiing, when a thaw came on. Stephenson was called,
and he said he should not turn out. He went to the fore-
castle with a rope in his band, and the complainant imme-
diately ghllared him ; on seeing which the mate came down,
and the complainant struck him, and attempted to put his
eyes out. _ _ _

Ellis, a Thames Police-officer, said the Captain obtained
a warrant against Stephenson two hours after one was
granted to the complainant.
Mr. BALLANTINE—Then you must swear the Captain.
The Captain them repeated on oath what he -had before
stated, and said that three men went to work, but when he
desired Stephenson to do so he peremptorily refused. He
took the rope in his band to frighten him.
Mr. BALLANTINE—You took it for the purpose of flog-
ging him, which you had no more right to do than I have
to flog my servants when they displease me.
The Mate, whose head was bound up and his eye disco-
loured, said that Stephenson inflicted the injuries.
The complainant said the mate slipped down and in-
jured his eye. He was bitting him behind while the Cap-
tain was larruping him with the rope.
The Captain—l did lace his jacket with the rope, but
it was after he collared me. I don't know how many times
I hit him, nor does he.
Mr. BALLANTINE said it was very discreditable for the
Captain to go with such a rope as that produced, and on a
Sunday afternoon in a crowded dock, to the forecastle to
flog a man. The law did not allow the master of a ship to
be judge and executioner in his own case. He did not
know what was done on the other side of the Atlantic, but
he should suppose that common sense was the same every
where.

The Captain—What am I to do, then, if I can't punish
a man when he won't do his duty ?

Mr. BALLANTINE—You are not allowed to flog him.
You could have come here and complained, if he was guilty
of misconduct. The law entrusts punishment to those who
try to blend a little judgment with a little discretion, not to
a hot-headed rash man. There has been an effort among all
three to throw into contempt the laws of the country, and
disturb the River.
The Captain—Why, is he to strike the master of a ship ?
It is very curious indeed!

Mr. BALLANTINE-Why I suppose there is something
peculiar in our atmosphere, but I know it is the case that
when a man finds another is about to flog him, or strike
him, he will defend himself. He was afraid of a blow, and
struck you.

Mr. BILODERIP—I quite agree with my brother Magis-
trate. You had no right to flog this man ; that you did
do it is very plain.
After a long altercation between the parties, the Captain
complaining that Stephenson frequently went ashore without
leave, and got drunk, while the other said his Captain was
a tyrant, and too partial to the " larrupping" system,
Mr. BALLANTINE said it was not at all creditable to
the Captain or to his country for such a scene to have taken
place on board an American ship. He would allow the
parties to retire, and come to an arrangement.
The seaman consented to accept of a sovereign and his
discharge from the ship, and the case terminated.

Fl ESCH I.—The following letter, written by Ficschi,
appears in the Journal des Debuts. The villainous spelling
of the original could in nowise be rendered :—" M. Sa-
joir, hussier to the Court of Peers—Pardon me, Sir, and
be indulgent to the mistakes without number which you
must find in this letter, both in the form of the language
and in the orthography ; for, though I take the pen to
write in French, I must tell you that I was my own teacher
and professor ; so that I hope you will pity my ignorance,
and from the present you may, moreover, judge my cha-
racter. After living, as you have done, nine years in Cor-
s ca, you can form a judgment of my country, and I hope
to finish its sketch to your liking. Monsieur Sajoir, you
did well to quit being a soldier in order to follow so fine a
surtont,. or employ, as that which you have in the first le-
gislative body in the kingdom. Happy is he who, like
you, reaches an advanced age, and sees his hairs grow grey
without reproach. In this case a man desires to live long
and serve as a mentor to others. But such a man—can
he be found ? I fear the search would be like that of Dio-
genes looking foil- a wise man with a lantern at noon day.
As for me, my mind is made up to drink the cup to the
dregs. Yes, he who committed so dreadful a crime, with-
out reflecting how odious he must become to society, ought
to conform himself to whatever penalty is inflicted on him.
The coward, I say, only fears death, and shudders lest the
ground should open under his feet. But I wait for death as for
a banquet to which lam invited. I regard death as a
general law. I never looked on life with pleasure.
For the brave man prefers honour to life, and death
to survival with disgrace and slavery. Yes, death does
a service to nature in taking away a man who suffers as I
do, since even if I survived, I should ever have the picture
of my horrible crime before me. - Even if I was at liberty,
my heart would be in bonds, and I shall be happier for
having paid the tribute to nature. Although I make so
unfortunate an end, my judges will say, the laws con-
demn you to death ; I must conform to them, and await
it firmly. If I survived, I should fear in the presence
of every man that he would say, There's a cowardly in-
father, who sold and betrayed his accomplice.' Yes, I
am his betrayer, and I say that the devil

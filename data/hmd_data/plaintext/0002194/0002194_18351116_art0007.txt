TRIESTE, Nov. s.—Our accounts from Greece arc not
very satisfactory. It seems that there is considerable fer-
mentation in Maine, which some ill-disposed persons might
easily take advantage of to embarrass the Government.
Under these circumstances it, is not 'likely that Count
Armansperg will quit Greece and leave the King, who,
perhaps has now more need of him than ever. The mind
of the Count has, indeed, received a very severe shock by
the loss of his eldest daughter, and he is weary of residing
in a country in which he has suffered so much that is disa-
greeable ; yet, notwithstanding all this, he will probably not
leave Greece till the arrival of the King of Bavaria, who in-
tends to visit Athens in the course of this month. Letters
from Munich say that King Louis would leave his capital
on the 18th of this month, and with only a few attend-
ants embark either here or at Ancona direct for Athens.
His Majesty will stop three months in: Greece. His
time will be spent in assisting his beloved son in the
difficult task which has fallen to his lot, of regenerating
a nation which has been degraded by centuries of
slavery, and to convince himself by his own experience of
the state things in a country, which, by the elevation
of a member. of the Royal- family of Bavaria to the
Greek throne, will naturally be closely connected with Ba-
varia. Another object of the King is probably to satisfy a
wish which, as a friend of the arts, he has long cherished, to
visit that classic country. There can be no doubt that the
visit of the revered Sovereign to Greece will be a happy
event, which will form an era in the history of the country.
It will not only allay the fermentation in the minds of the
people, but also open.new sources to the arts and sciences.
INio news from Egypt. It is said that the sanitary cordon
in the Papal States, on account of the cholera, will be
broken up.
MUNICH, Nov. 6.—The King's departure from Greece
is fixed for the 16th inst. His Majesty thinks to return in
March next.
SMYRNA, OCT. 17.—8 y the Levant steam-boat we have
received letters from Alexandria of the 12th of this month.
On the 116, the Nile Government steam-boat sailed for
Beiroot, to fetch Ibrahim Pacha, who was 'expected in
Egypt. 111plionlet also was preparing to return to Cairo.
The .cholera was still at Alexandria, but there
,were only a
few cases. Dreadful misery and great discontent prevailed
'in Alexandria and in all Egypt.
The accounts from Syria, received by the same oppor-
tunity, are to the 30th of September, and much more in-
teresting. It seems that the Druses, betrayed by one of
their chiefs, and, it is believed, by Emir Bescher himself,
had been surprised by the Egyptian troops in the village of
Del Kamar, and dispersed. Ibrahim Pacha, with 12,000
men, who' had been gradually assembled, had" advanced to
Mount Lebanon, and made prisoners of the greater part of
the principal inhabitants of the mountain. The Druses,
being without a leader, suffered themselves to be disarmed
without resistance. The greater part of Lebanon was al-
ready subdued, and, as Ibrahim advanced, be continued' to
receive-fresh reinforcements. The remainder has doubtless
not hesitated to submit. The Syrians, disarmed, and struck
with terror, do not venture even to.complain of their op-
pressors.

BRUSSELS, Nov. 13.—Yesterday the creditors of M.

Dehaes met at the Tribunal of Commerce to appoint as-

signees ; nineteen creditors appeared. The balance sheet,
which was produced, .shows that the debts of the bankrupt
are 1,372,719 francs. The assets are estimated at
190,000 francs.
In the Chamber of Representatives yesterday (the 12th)
the Order of the Day was the general debate on the pro-
ject of law relative to the postage of letters.
No person offering to speak on the project, the Chamber
proceeded to discuss the several articles.
Article 1. From the Ist of January, 1836, the postage
of letters shall be regulated according to the distance in a
straight line between the Post-office of the place where the
letter is put in and where it is to be delivered, and this
postage shall be charged according to the following tariff :
For' a single letter, to a distance of 30 kilometres, 2 de-
cimes ; from 30 to 60 kilometres, 3 decimes ; from 60 to
106 kilometres, 4 decimes ; from 100 to 150 kilometres, 5
deeimes ; and so on, adding 1 decime for every 50 ki-

lometres.
Article 2. A single letter from and for the same com-
mune to pay 1 decime.
Article 3. A single letter from and for communes de-
pending on the same Post-office to pay two decimes.
Article 4. Many amendments being proposed, the article,
with the amendments, was sent back to the Central Sec-
tion. (The 4th Article relates to letters transmitted by
Foreign Post-offices.)
Art.s; Litters weighing less than 10 grammes to be charged
single, fronlo to 15 grammes one-rate and a half, from 15
to 20 two rates, from 20 to 30 two rates and a half,. and so
on, adding half a rate for a single letter for every additional
weight of 10 grammes.
Art. 6,7, and 6, were adopted without discussion, as
follows :
Art. 6 fixes a low rate for letters addressed to subalterns
and privates in the army.
Art. 7. A letter, to which a pattern is attached, shall be
charged as in the preceding articles ; and the pattern shall
be charged at one third of the postage of a letter of the
same weight, but it must be only under a band, so that
there may be no doubt whatever of its nature, and that it
shall have no writing but the numbers of the order. It
the pattern is not -by itself the postage shall in like manner
be only one-third of that on a letter of the same weight
the postage can, however, never be below that of a single
letter.

Art. 8. The postage shall be charged in decimes; and
all fractions shall be computed to the advantage of the
Treasury.
Art. 9.—The franking of journals, periodicals, books,
music, prospectuses, and printed notices and advertisements
of all kinds is fixed, whatever may be the distance in the
kingdom, at one centime per sheet less than twelve square
decimetres ; two centimes per sheet from_ twelve to thirty
square decimetres ; four centimes per sheet from thirty to
sixty square decimetres : and so on, adding two centimes
for thirty square decimetres, or any portion of thirty square
decimetres.
'The half of the amount of the postage on the journals
shall be paid into the Treasury, and the other half divided
among the clerks of the offices which dispatch and. receive
the papers.
The central section proposed to omit this last paragraph.
The Minister of 'Finance could not agree to the suppres-
sion of the paragraph, which would be contrary to the. regu-
lar distribution of the journals confided to the Post Office.
The clerks, who have made agreements with the journals,
are interested in the regular distribution of them when they
receive part of the postage.
M. Gendebien• not only supported the view of the Mi-
nister, but wished that the clerks might receive the whole
of -the postage as they did in the time of King William,

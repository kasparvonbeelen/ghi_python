and from 250 to abo horses, mitre advancing by' the
r.ad of Beia, th-ey attacked in frbnt of
the gate of Bacr.l ; &tended by the 4th company of

the lt.i they suffered, alit! tile difficulty
which a general attack so exit titled a front. pre-

on the wealce,t

" With this object he marched by his right flank
a colu►un of atta, k of 200 men,- lilac( d them on an
height in the immediate vicinity of ttint place, from
wheike, with great celerity, and under a well sup•
ported titelrotn.our truops, they arrived at the city,
bloke open a gale and entered it, Whilst' the file
or their comrades and the attacks evtly where
made were intended to divert us Irons their
pc inctpal object, • bat it .I.4as 'in vain, because the
Captdin of the Cadii Tiratleurs,. Dori. N C.. PA t.O
M 8 NS, who commanded all a batiatton on, the lett,
seeing his
,design, frustraltd it by a charge with the
bayonet ; .he.causeri a great kiss to those who occu-
pied th4e streets, and put in complete route thou who
fled towards the country.

" thiS was going on, the encrny.united.
:mother cohnun of 400 men, and , by. the s4tue di-

into it, putting in gnat danger and retreat the troops

enemy, and seeing their worthy Colotnandei all,
inconsequence of a ball K. filch .settt through Ilan;
ther, enkiocts to revenge his heroic blood, attookud
the eticaly with such deteuninat)on, 'that 44
drove thew back. by. the same way,they entered
with great loss.

The lass,,of :the enemy amounts to 800 in killed

retreat with stiat precipitation., that they left .111 the

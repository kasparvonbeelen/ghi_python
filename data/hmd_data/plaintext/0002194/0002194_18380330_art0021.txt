DEFENCE OF SLAVERY.

TO SIR GEORGE GREY.

Spa GRORGE—T listened with deep interest to your very
able and effective speech, delivered in the House of Commons
last night; and as one of a body of men whom you thought right to
assail several times, where they could not defend themselves,
I beg to submit to you the following remarks, which apply only
to the great principle in dispute.
You, Sir George, in an official capacity, have given utterance to
sentiments which we did not expect from you as a man and as an
Englishman. A contract (you say) was entered into between
the British Parliament and the West Indian proprietors. Are
the negroes bound by that contract ? Are the fortunes and
persons of men to be disposed of by a bargain, in the making
of which they had no voice whatever ? There exists, Sir
George, in India, a large body of men called Thugs.
They enter into a more solemn compact than that which, you
say, involves the faith of Parliament; and the object of it is
to commit as many murders as possible. And why is not that
compact binding? Clearly because it is immoral. But, Sir
George, very near to the command " Thou shalt not kill," is
another, " Thou shalt not steal." And what is the object of
that infamous contract you have eulogised? To commit rob-
bery —to deprive nearly 800,000 human beings of freedom till
1840 ; and all of them who can work of the wages of their
labour. " The hire of the labourer, which is of you kept
back by fraud, crieth." In the name of Almighty God, I
ask, who gives you and the planters a right to seize and ap-
propriate to the masters' use the hard-earned fruits of the
black man's toil, till the year 1840 ?
In concluding, let me assure you that, in the minds of a
large number of gentlemen who were your auditors last night,
and whose opinions you do not and cannot despise, the
name of Sir George Grey will henceforward be associated
with what they must deem a most needless and callous defence
of fraul and slavery.—l am, Sir George,
One who hoped better things from a Liberal Government,
W. ROBINSON.

WILLIAMSTADT, APRIL 12.—After having been,
as it were, cut off from the world for four months,
our unfortunate neighbours see the near end of all
their sufferings. The garrisons of Bergen-op-
Zoom and Antwerp, on hearing the fust news of
the great events at Paris, ceased all hostilities
against the Allies, and hoisted the White Cockade
with cries of Five toi‘is XVIII. Already the
gates of these two important places are- open. to
whoever chuses to enter them or to go "out. This
news, which has been brought to-day to the
English Commandant of this place, is the more
-aoreeable, RS the Ames were resolved to at-s
tack both these two towns and Fort Batz with'.
vigimr, and thus the lives of-many brave men are
spared.- It is also affirmed, that the
Cockade has been displayed for 'these two days
on.the towers and ramparts. of Flushing, nhd that
the French troops 'there and in the whole island
of Walcheren wait -only for 'orders from their
Goverment to give up the whole island to the

of the, 31st March, contain. the -fotlowing ac-
count :

" 'the Princess 'Eliza, who, on the occupation
'of Tuscany by the .Neapolitan troops, fled to
Lucca, has been obliged to leave that place in
haste, because the English arrived only 5 hours
after her departure.,
• S:le,lins left in her palace all the costly fur-
niture, all her cariages, and 30 horses of great
value---The Princess arrived on the I9that Turin,
'when haviug stopped a ..few moments with her
brother-in-law, •Prince Borghese, she proceede'd
to Park.-

" The Anglo-Sicilian Army broke up on the
13th from Leghorn, and the advanced guard Shortly
after arrived at Luc-ca, whence the Princess Eliza
hastily departed- with an escort of Neapolitan
troops. Lord Bentinck -vent to the head-quar-
ters of the King. of Naples at Reggio, and hating
staid there a few days, proceeded to the head-
quarters of tount'Bellegarde.!" .
LEGHORIti, MARCH la.-Lord Bentinck, who,
came from .Naples.by land-, and arrived t Wo -"days
after the first division of the English army,, has
published the following. Declaration
" Frauar:s !—Great Britain has landed her troops oil your
cuasts ; she holds out her hand to you in order to ueliver you
from the iron yoke of Buonaparte.—Portitgal, Spain, Sicily,
and Holland, attest the generous and disinterested principles
which animate her. Spain, by its firmness -and its bravery,
and the asaistance of its Allies, has accomplished the noblest
enterprize—,the French are driven from its territory, its inde-
pendence is secured, its civil liberty- restored.—Sicily, by
the support of the same Power, has been preserved front
the general deluge, and has suffered nothing. By the
generous sentiments of its Prince, it has risen from
slavery to liberty, and aspires to -resume its ancient lustre
among independent nations. Holland aims at the same ob-
ject. Shall, then, Italy alone remain under the Yoke ? shall
Italians, alone, fight against Italians for the advantage of a
Tyrant, and to confirm the slavery of their country? Italians!
delay ao longer; and you in particular, Italian Army, reflect
that the greatest interest of your country is already in your
hands. Warriors of Italy, you are not called uPon to join
our party; we vrig.fr you to assert your own rights, and to be

united etrorn restore Italy to what she was in better ti,'''''
and whicil Spain already is now.

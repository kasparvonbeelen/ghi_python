'caved his spies, after the language which
his Government has made use of, the prin-
ciples it has- avowed, and its known subservience
to the dictates of thelloly Alliance. Is Eng-
land then alone to be duped by the sinister po
licy of France ? Is she to see the edifice of
-South American independence _ undermined by
the petty and indirect acts of a"Minister, who
says one thing to the ear, and another to the eye ;
who says, that to aid the freedom of those dis-
tant countries is to promote the cause of anarchy,
and yet accredits Commissioners to them; who
pledges himself not to assist Spain to recover her
Colonies, and yet sends out fleets to countenance
the Royalists, aad to give them all the indirect
aid which they can, or dare afford ? Is not the
continuance of so large a French army in the gar-
risons of Spain another indisputable proof of the
ntsistance which France is actually lending to
Spain (or the re-conquest of the Colonies ? The
finances of Ferdinand, ruined as they are by his
own dishonesty, would never enable him to
keep up an army sufficient at the same time
to preserve the peace of his unfortunate kingdom
at home, and to make attempts upon the inde-
pendence of the new States. The French forces,
however, are sufficiently numerous to retain the
Peninsula for him in abject slavery, and thus al-
low him to dispose of all the Spanish troops
which he can muster for his foreign expeditions.
And yet, with these things staring us openly in
the face, there are persons who say that every,
thing France has done with respect to South Ame-
rica has been '1 most satisfactorily explained."

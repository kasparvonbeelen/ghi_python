LONDON MARKETS,
From the " London New Price Current" of yesterday.)

he week was general and extensive, but the request has since
fallen off; but without producing any reduction in the prices.
The estimated sales for the week are 3,400 hhds. and,trs., in.
eluding the Trinidad and Barbadoes public sales; the former
currency is fully supported. In the Refined market there is no
export demand, as the shippers cannot purchase at the prices
demanded ; for crashed 315. is asked, and buyers offer 295, 6d.
and 30s. No sales of Lumps for export. A parcel of good
Hamburg Loaves, patent, has been sold at 325. The demand
for fine goods for the home consumption of the country is on a
more confined scale than usual, but there is little variation in
prices. The business doing in Refined Sugars this day conti-
nues almost wholly confined to the home trade, and the quoted
prices are fully maintained. The stock on hand, notwithstand-
ing there is no demand for export, does not appear to have ac-
cumulated much. This day by public sale 22 hhds. 27 brls.

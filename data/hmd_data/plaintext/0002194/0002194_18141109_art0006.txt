The Slieech havine.been read, (as given in our
Report of tht. -

Lord BatnroitT said, that -on rising to move an
Addiess to the Prince Regent, on the occasion of
his most gracious Speech, he hlu -to regret that
the nodertakint; had not fall.ai upon a person

subject; at the same Cline, he should niakt' his
.ft.bserviitions w tit a full reliaoce on the, known ii-
berality and indulgonce of the House. lie should
Proceed to take notice of the different topics con-
tained in the Speech of bis Royal Highness, and
he trusted the House would
.listen tOhiat at-
tension. With respect to one part of the Speech,
lie was ennviueed that -every
.IgeMber in the
-House would regret, as deCiily as he did, to
his Majesty's I:intent-ea illness still
continnes;• and that after the lapse of another
yeas., there should be such little prospett of his
aecovery. • He should not occupy the time of the
}louse, by taking a retrospect of the great polia
deal atiairs•which WI occur-red since the. coin-
meocement cif the, last Session, except so far as
to contrast the.ptesent . situation of, the. country-
with -that in :which it stood 1•2 utonth,s ago., Lvent•s
hadoccurred since that time which were greater
than thenioat sanguine i:nagitiation coal(' Intec au-

the termination of the insatiate atabijon of duo-
; Lit the praasi.e toe the-t-oudoct ot the
war which has so -inivpily terminated, is 'most
justly due to the Priiice Regent
.and the Al.
lied Sovereigns. Our Cabinet ;:Council of that
thins were most truly conspieaona for their tent-
per, their firunie.ss, and decision; and the House
:mkt. see, avail' the highest .satislaction, that
to suet) temper,- such firmness, and such de-.
cisfoo, are they indelnted for the Present si-
tuation of. the country. if we :take' a view
of our actual coadition at lionni," we if:id our-
selves at peace-With all the world, wits the ex-
ception-of Atiierica. Who coala have anticipated;
' lit this tee' last year, Soh gloriousauccesses, Sacir
unparalleled events They Were indeed beyond
all hunsan.evieetaneyntid• cadet:lntim-1. The next
t:yic in the Speeeli to Which should alhide was
present war 'with America. He'could not but
laineat, as the whole country must lament, the-
:cciiitiuuaiuce of host:lities with the people of, the.
Unit eile...States ; bit it was highly. consoling to•
ki-tow that the Prinee ilegent had assnred the.
, House, that nothing he left unaitempted
winch might brig this contest to a speedy tenni-
; nation. it is N zierica, who .stands as the unprina.
cipled aggressor, in this contest ; but we might
reflect with prude, that our successes hitherto bare
been tinvaried.: He conid not hut congratunt the
Hatise- on these Saccesses ;: for _they proved :bat
navy and army, when united, were capable
of performing -prodijes of valour. Yet when
have they been •so-united—when Lave they found
scope for their bravery and enterprize without
parforming such prodigies ? Their achieveineats
In America were worthy of the 'great
.charaac-
ter : the Americans had now. to. lament the
destruction of. their flotilla in the ,Patuxent.
and
~the defeat of their army, which allowed
a. mere detachinent- of o trops to take
the capital ef. their States. Yet- tho*e brave
troo;-,s had been falsely Calumniveil by 11:latiisnu
and leis adherents, Who find charged them With
the plundering of private property. But- never ,
was a charge snore groundless. Undoubtedly-the
Stores • and =munition -were destroyed ; and ,if
we dal also destroy the public buildings of ‘Vash-
, ington, it . was in
~retsiliatioa for the, atrocities
.tommitted and repeated by them
-in Upper Ca-
nada. He had also to congratulate the -1-loase.,on
the successes of :his Majesty's arms iii the Inure
northera parts of the United States, where they'
have gained an extent of territory to the east of
the Penobscot ; an-acquisition svhich could Ilk fail
to be of considerable importance. Ile could not I
help viewing it in the most favourable light,-as one
more proof to the Americans of the hopelessness,
on their part, of a continuance of the contest.
But while we had ground to rejoice at the. victo-
ries of ftitir arms on every part of the 'American
shores, . our triumph was damped by having to la-
ment the tall of an Officer of the highest talents
and the brightest promise. In the death of this
gallant Commander our country has sustained no
cominoa loss. He felt that no eulogy could do
justice to his distinguished merits. He could say
much more on this affecting topic; but he was
aware that whatever he might add, could but ill
describe the sensatitais of lainiscif, the 'louse, or

acknowledge that' lie had made the amende hOnnr-
able to his rorraer, colleagues-, since he had ac-
cepted a situation under the very men with whom
he would not condescend to advise. If he ad-
mired the honourable amende, made by his Ex-
cellency the Ambassador to the Court of Lisbon,
equally did lie admire the selection of him for that
situation which, he was going ' to fill.—Had he,
been chosen to go to the 'Congress at Ghent, he

thing to be done, it Was prOhable he could not do
harm,. was one of the happiest selections that could
be made. Why an AMbasSador should at all be ap-
pointed to the Court of Lisbon he could not tell.
But hr the expence which this appointment threw
on the country, be would not begrudge the Right
Hon. Gent.all the honour Of the situation he had oh-
tained, nor the stipend attached,to it, nor any of the
distinctions to which it might lead, eventhoogh the

That shoals of privateers visited every sea, took
posseSsion of every merchant ship, and were
still left onchastised? He was now todook,to what.
had been done on,the Lakes. not Ministers
been guilty of the folly--aof the ChildiOt folly. of
sending out frigates in frames to America, there
to he conveyed up the rapids of the river, to con-
tend with the Americans. for superiority on the
Lakes ? This was, part of their wise system ; but
things still more graye were to be urged against
them. Their negligence bad left a gallant. Officer
destitute of the means of successful resistance. He
had made a desperate effort to extricate himself from
the situation in which he unfortommately found him-
self. The result was unfortunate ; buta Court Mar-
tial had determined the attempt was justifiable,
though his means were not such as to give it suc-
cess. The even which led to this Court _Martial,
occurred through Captain Barclay not receiving
those succours he ought to have been supplied
with from Sir James Yeo, or from the Admiralty.
The Court-Martialwa,s held in February last, and
he now asked, if any steps had been taken for
calling Sir James Yeo to a Court-Martial, for not
.supplying Captain Barclay with. the means he re-
quired successfully to contend with the enemy ?
If this bad not been
.done, be should be glad to
know if the Admiralty did not tacitly acknow-
ledge the blame to,rest with,theM ? It was desir-
able that the occurrences on the Lakes should
be strictly inquired into. Lately a variety of
complaints bad ben exhibited against a .gallant
Officer, Sir George Prevost, who was said to be
Coining borne. He would advise those who seem-.
ed to expect miracles, because , miracles had in
some instances interposed for. us-, not to look.
for them as matters of course, and he hoped they
would well consider, before they condemned Sir,
G. Prevost, if it were not possible that he, like
Captain Barclay, had done all that could be done
with the means entrusted to
.his care. The;Nohle
Lord had congratulated the House on the great
acquisition of glory, of safety, and of territory
gained by our successes in the .Penobscot. He,
for his part, did not see how these could make
Canada more secure, or promise the near ap-
proach of peace ; it was said, by giving us a new
boundary. This, far from hastening the arrival
of peace, would be the watch-word for resis-
tance, and war throughout the United States;
and prolong the contest to an indefinite period.
It bad been said the business of Washington
avutild make a great impression on other parts
of the United States. He. apprehended it was
meant an impression favourable to the termination
of hostilities. He could not but lament that Ge-
neral Ross had been obliged to be concerned in a
measure so discordant with that conduct which had
called forth unmingled admiration at the close of
the European contest—so abhorrent; so incon-
sistent with the habits of a free and generous
people--7so to be hated and detestetl, condemned
and abjured. What had been the effect of thiS
operation ? To conciliate to time Government
those before adverse it—to put in-motion the militias
of States who before were not suffered to march ; to
give a new weapon into the bands of Mr. Madison,
and to do away time report that had got abroad, that
several of the States were likely to he severed
from the Union, ;by the ,convulsions arising from
the war. Of their private. divisions we now hear
no more ; all were united. to revenge this great
wrong. In burning Washington, we. bad acted
woise than the Goths when they:were before the
walls of Rome. They yielded. to the reasoning of
Belisarius, who urged, :that to deSfroy the public
works of that city would be but to raise a mono-
went to the folly of their destroyers. If the Awe,
ricans had wantonly destroyed a village in Canada,
was retaliation necessary when the. Act was dis-
avowed by. the American cyvernment ? Iu a late
dispatch from Mr. Monroe, :it would be seen this
was done ; and it, appeared that an American
Officer, who had encouraged the outrage referred
to, bad been dismissed in disgrace, even without
the form.of a trial. But if this had not.been thine,
was. it worthy a nation like Engiand,in a spirit of
.retaliation to destroy. the, rising splendour of an
infant capital ; to, burn the capitol..in which the.
Senate held their sittings, to turn their arms
:against the Inonurnents,of art there established,
and to descend to pillage private property ? Yet

these affairs. there, was a remarkable mystery with
respect to the conduct of Sir Alexander Cochrane.
Ought we, he asked, to fight for vengeance ? No ;
ipit, to, finish the war. Would the burning of
Washington, the stealing the President's furni-
ture, or taking the tobacco and merchandise •
of. the unfortunate 'people, tend to hush the
war ? No.; they could not have this effect ; and
therefore such conduct was unjustifiable. He did
not know that it would be considered proper at this
period to animadvert on the negociations now going
on; but he was not sorry to have an opportunity of
saving in his place, what had occurred to him on
subjects which were open to the observation of
all. When the Treaty of Paris was 'concluded,
be thought the conduct of the Noble Lord (Lord.
Castlereagh), except in one instance, deserved the
approbation of Parliament. He, however, could
not shut his eyes to facts whiCh came out before
that Noble Lord set out far Vienna, and before
theclose of the last Session, which seemed total-
ly at variance with the arrangements proSpectiVely
looked to as the result of the CongresS now Sit;;
Plug. He had lamented, the probable fate of
the Little Republic Of ;Genoa, and the conduct
of Austria in
,Italy, in attaching totersell the
Italian' States, and declaring the System then
acting, upon should be lasting. He' lamen'ted
that Royal Families, now restored to their ancient
inheritances, had not learnt in adversity to treat
the countries over which they presided as the pro-
perty of the subjects rather than of the Sovereign.
He could not but wonder that men; however
cramped their ideas, byedieation, superstition,
ignorance, should not.lrave been taught by mis-
fortune that the interests of their people were
their own. He feared few of the restored *Mo-
narchs had received this salutary lesson in the
manner. he .could wish, and that some-of them, on
returniug to power, had recourse to every 'means.
they - could.think of; •in order to .put out of
men's heads all idea of their having'a right to be
free. This feeling had manifeSted itself 'in
the rude and unfeeling reply which had been
given to certain patriots, whit had. pray-
ed that their little republic might be spared 5.
" that republics were no longer in:fashion." If
such a spirit were abroad, and he feared it was,`
and in one quarter of the Continent it was knoWn
to be so, it was to be feared the COnSequence'
would be the loss of liberty, which was the worst of
all consequences, or a new s truggle for freedom. The
people, it was to be apprehended, would be com-
pelled to ;submit to slavery, and make • a • new
effort to expel those who have so misconduct-
ed themselves, When he.heard that great part 'of
Saxony was to be given-to Prussia, and that Saxony
was to be,- no longer a Power in Europe.,
felt great: .sorrow, and thought • not of the
King, for his fate was but a secondary conside-
ration, but the people were unjustly dealt by.—
The King of Saxony had not the same -opportu-
nity for changing .as .others 'had.- Boonaparte had
possession not only of his country but of his per-
son ; and thus circumstanced, he remained with
him till the .batile of Leipsic. For this, was
Saxony to be divided among the Coalesed Powers ?
Such, a division would be as unprincipled An act
as was that of the partition of Poland. With re-
spect to the last mentioned country, it was known •
that a general feeling had got abroad in the world,
in favour seeing the kingdom of Poland resror-
.The Emper6r of RusSia, who might be sup-
posed most interested in opposing this, was un-
derstooi to be willing 'to consent to it; if the
other Monarchs of Europe would abstain froth
seeking further • aggrandizement. Monarchs
were often very fond of being magnanimous at
the expence of others ;• Alexander NV
lingto be so at his own cost, if Austria•would
sist front- her attempts on Italy, if Prussia does
not seek to extend her ride in Germany; On the
part of •the Prince Regent, an act had transpired
from which he thought evil might be augured,
and for doing which, if there was any one:thing
in the Prince's conduct, since he assumed thereins
of Government, which more than another would 1
: hurt the King his father, could he be .made
quainted with it, was that one thing: Ws Majesty
had been made King of Hanover.. -This, he be-
lieved, bad been done by an Order in'Council. In
the new state of things on the Continent, the Prince,
instead of being advised to say, " let us preserVe
the titles and distinctions anciently attached to our
terriories," had • said, on perceiving -the other
Electors of Germany were made Kings—" Since
they put on regal state here, ill dress up my' fa-
ther like them." - It seemed there 'was to be an
arondisseinent of territory
.for Hanover, as 'it was
called, the consequence of which- would be, Ha-•
nover would more than ever be likely to involve
us in wars, -by bringing us in, contact with inte-
rests to which we could not be obnoxious before.
The Republic of Genoa, it was now underStOod,
was to be extinguiShed. The measure was one of
, which
.he could never approve. There was a
time when the Allies were glad to seek ltssistanee
from every quarter—when they conceived it - of
importance to bring. Bernadotte; and with him
Sweden, into titefr views ; not only did they
treat with Bernadotte,- but with one more
nearly connected with Btionaparte, a Prince whose
kingdom is in the south of Italy. His assistance
was .solicited, and he was credibly informed (and
he believed it),that a sortof engagement had been
made with hint, which if it were broken would be
a foul blot on our national faith. Reports had been
abroad that his removal was contemplated. • He had
heard, that since he became the Sovereign ofNaples,
there had been a degree of order and good govern-
ment introduced,
,and a proscription Of murder
which had gained him the hearts of the,Neapoli-
tans, and caused a striking distinetiori to appear
between ;his subjects and those of Prince Ferdi-
nand. In time threatened progress of the SoVe

reigns of Europe to darkness, might happen
that thiS Prince would becitme obnoxious to some
• of them. He hoped, however, there would be
no alteration there; that Genoa and Saiony
would be saved, and Poland "restored. Mo 7

Now turning to another subject, Which had,'in no
small degree, caused those arrears for which they-
were called upon to proVide, he could not bits
:lament the treasure which had been wast,ed.,.the
:blood which had been lavishly shed in the Penin-

Was on'e which related to his' department. It-was -
asked Whether any pecuniary-assistance had been.
given to the King of Spain to 'assist •hitn'ine.

with the consent of Parliament for her co-opera-
tion in the war. Had any advance breii uide,lt

Stating, at the same time, that the enemy (the
British) were exasperated, and burning to invade

Was sufficient to she%v, that aware of the atti'ocity

The people who' did not perish amidst the rune:t

Gentleman complained, although • the loss of
what shelters- and supports life must have been
still more painful,twthe sufferers.. But even on
that :ground, what
.-had-. been the -conduct

tal of Upper :Canada, this was; their proceeding-.
-After carrying Off, by their•own account,' all' the
arms, ammunition, :and property, Of *all kinds
which they could remove, they burnt all the pub-
lic buildings, and the troops .re-embarked. This
was a case fully in point.--.--[llere Mr.' Whitbread
said, that the nature of the property destroyed
Was very inferior.]--It might be so ; the value
might be less considerable, but that was nut the
fault of the enemy, who, had they' gained pos-
session of more important objects', would not have
sheaved them more mercy. Thecase, he therefore
conceived, was entirely in point. If another ex-
ample* was wanting of the wanton and, desolat-
ing spirit of the American Commanders,' it was
in his power to lay it before the House. He con-
ceived no body of people more entitled to protec-
tion, and more deserving to be freed'froM the ca-

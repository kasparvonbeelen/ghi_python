THE REPUBLIC OF TEXAS AND

MR. O'CONNELL.

[We published in The Sun, on August 27, a letter
from Mr. O'Connell to Mr. Sturge, on the subject of
slavery in the Texas. As this is a very important ques-
tion, whether considered in relation to our commerce
with that newly-founded Republic, or in relation to
humanity, we think our readers will peruse the following
letter, in reply to Mr. O'Connell, with interest. Mr.
Kennedy is a well-known man of letters, and as he has
recently visited Texas his testimony will be considered
as extremely valuable.]

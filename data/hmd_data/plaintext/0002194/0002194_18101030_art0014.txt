In consequence of this a rePte;;eutation was made

In 'behalf oi the prisoner it appeared, front the.tno-

The prisoner's charaCter was also represented in

JUBILEE BUST.—The loyalty and attacnment of
'the City of London to.the .House tif Hanover, could
by no means be more conspicuously evinced than by
yLe unanimous adoption. of the motions of which
kilices were given by Messrs. JACKES and (lofty, at
the lest Common Council. Not only will the placing .
ofht9 MAJESTY'S Bust. in their Chambers be a tribute
..vitlrttly of the present generation; but a lasting me-
tll°Jiid, po'terity of .the remarkable era which
galled for this testimony of public respect for a good
„..14.g. The enduring marble will remain a proud
monument of the inaproVed state of
,the arts, at the

11'a.rided the exercise of that best calculated to trans-
-4
i.,4
to the latest times the counterpart of, an aged
iand reveled Sovereign. Sculpture, we have lung re- ,
°iCed. to observe, bas been making a very _rapid Pro-,
fress. in Britain since its revival, which we may date
riz the present reign, and no better proof of our
th
Pre-eminence in this noble art could be given than
at implied in Mr. QUIN's proposed motion. ..
fio all who have seen TURN EHELLI's justly cele-
brated Jtibilee Bust, it has been a subjed of the
warmest admiration. Highly approved, by- his MA-
TESTY.. with a' facilitk.not afforded to any- other liv-
g
artist, he has well availed himself of his MA-
-4,llYrles gracious condescension in sitting to him,
"d given to ;he world one of the most perfea like-'
tessest the marb'e was capable of receivmg.

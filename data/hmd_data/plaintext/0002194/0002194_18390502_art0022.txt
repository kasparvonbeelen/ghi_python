CHURCH RA TES.

Yesterday a meeting of the Baptists' Union, representing
1 by their ministers and delerratis four hundred and fifty-five
associated Churches, compris,d of Gi),884 members, was
tiaid in Now Park-street Chapel, Borough, at which the
Kay. T. Swan, of Birmingham, presided.
sifter some ordinary routine business had been attended
tn, the CIIAIRMAN Called Upon
The Rev. Dr. PRICE, of Hackney, to move the adoption
of certain resolutions, Cie last of which called upon the
Loettmg to declare, that all legislation in matters of reli-
gion was ipso facto irival:d, and urged upon the meeting
the itapertance of pledging themselves to refuse the pay_
Went of Church-rates whenever they were demanded.
The Roe. Gentleman then addressed the ineetinv, and
was followed by the Rev. Mr. Weary of Great Alissen-
den, who seconded the resolutions. After a lengthened
discusaion, in which many of the Delegates took part, and
for which we regret we cannot find room,
WNI. ‘VATSOti, jun., Esq., moved, as an amendment,
that the last clause b:1 omitted. As a professional man,
he argued that when a Church-rate had been made, resist-
a,ice to it was illegal, aid that the Quakers would hays
acted a more consistent part, if, instead of refusing to pay
the rats when levied, they had come forward and resisted
its being imposed in the Vestry.
The Rev. Ilowaati HINTON briefly seconded the
amendment.

A division took place, when there appeared—
For tho amendmeut
Against it
Majority

The original motion of curse was lost.
Aftoer some further resolutions, condemnatory of the
renduct pursued towards the apprentices in Jamaica, and
denunciations of the crime of slavery in America, the
meeting separated.

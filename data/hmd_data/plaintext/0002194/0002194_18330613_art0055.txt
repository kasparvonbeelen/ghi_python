DR URY-LANE THEATRE.

The season terminated at this Theatre last night by the
following Addre.s from Mr. Cooper, the Stage manager
under the new Lessee :
" Ladies and Gentlemen—The termination of the season
demanding from the Lessee an acknowledgment of the patronage
you have been pleased to bestow on his exertions, I am deputed
by him to appear before you for that purpose.
" It is not, he hopes, too great an encroachment on your pa-
tience to state, that, with a view to the furtherance of public
amusement, he has had the honour of introducing to your no-
tice the strongest company of English talent that research or
money could procure; and the fashion having been set and
sanctioned in another theatre of introducing foreign assistance
—(Hisses)--he did not hesitate (though without prejudice to
our native resources) to procure the very first artists of Eu-
rope—all of whom have successively appeared before you, and
have been honoured with your favour.
" It this desire to please has not met with as much remune-
ration as could be wished, the Lessee is so far from making Dom.
plaint, that he acknowledges with gratitude the encouragement
which has been extended; and in retiring from the manage-
ment of the theatre, he sincerely thanks you.—(Applause.)
" Being appointed the future Stage-manager—(Loud ap.
plause followed this announcement)—by the new Lessee, I am
requested by him—in alluding to the novel circumstance of
the two national theatres being united—to state that the sole
object of such a junction is to represent the dramatic litera.
ture of the country in a more efficient manner than it other-
wise could possibly be done ; and that as the result which he
anticipates is the increase of public gratification, he most re-
spectfully and confidently solicits the public support, assur.
ing you, as such a responsibility is only held in trust for your
entertainment, that every means shall be adopted to provo
himself worthy of the patronage you may be pleased to bestow.
—(Applause.)
" The Ladies and Gentlemen of the Theatre request me to
return you their grateful thanks; and on their behalf I most
respectfully bid you farewell until the beginning of the ensuing
season."—(Applause.)

SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.

HAMPTON RACES, JuxE 12.

Tne many attractions held out by these popular and

long established races, heightened by judicious manage-
ment and liberal expenditure, were in a great degree neu-
tralized by the state of the weather, which, without being
wet, was sufficiently tempestuous to keep away any but
the must determined admirers of the sport. So violent

was the wind that a vast deal of mischief was done at
Twickenham, Teddington, and other places in the vicinity ;
many large trees were blown down, and out-houses en-
tirely unroofed. On the race course all was confusion till
a few hours previous to the commencement of the races;
nor Was it till assistance was afforded the proprietors of
the booths and stands by Sir Dudley Hill, that many of
the customary erections were completed with strength
enough to resist the wind. Nothwirhstanding this draw-
back, the attendance was highly respectable, certainly
more numerous than could reasonably have been expected
under the circumstances. The stewards were—the
Earl of Chesterfield, Earl of Albemarle, and Lord
Adolphus Fitzclarence. Each of the Noble Lords
was present, and did all in their power to pro-
mote the amusements of the day. To their influence,
and the extensive personal connection of Sir Dudley
Hill (proprietor of the Hurst), we attribute the number of
fashionables present. We noticed, besides many of the
gentry resident in the immediate neighbourhood of the
course, the following :—Earl of Chesterfield, Earl of Al-
bemarle and Lady Caroline K-ppel, Lord Albert Conyng-
ham, Lord Adolphus Fitzclarence, Lord Waldegrave,
Hon. Captain Rous Hon. Grantley Berkeley, Hon. Co-
lonel Anson, Sir Dudley Hill, Sir A. Halliday, Sir V.
Cotton, General Cookson, General Moore, Colonel Peel,
Colonel Bowater, Colonel Udny, Mr. Payne, Mr. A.
Hunter, Mr. Spalding, Mr. Gardner, &c. &c.
A brilliant company and good sport are expected this
day (par excellence the grand day). The King's Plate
will be an jute, esting race, the entry comprising the fol-
lowing horses :—Lord Chesterfield's Tourist, Mr. Cole-
man's Bohemian, Mr. Turner's Denbles, Mr. Jones's
Jessie, Mr. G. Edward's Camel filly, Mr. Martyn's
Misletoe, Mr. Smith's The Witch, Lord Lowther's Laz-
zarone, Mr. Messer's Cricket, Mr. Meyiick's Dinah, and
Mr. Doekeray's Spaniel.
Several improvements have been effected on the Hurst
to prevent, the accidents that so frequently occur on a
small course, and afford additional accommodati9n to the
visitors; one of the principal is the removal of the booths
for stabling, which formerly stood at the back of the
titands, on the inside of the course, and which are now
placed so as to permit an uninterrupted view of the
running.
The races yesterday were decided as follow :
The Hurst Cup, value 501. in spcie, for horses of all
ages. The winner to be sold for 150 soya., if de-
manded, &c. Heats, once round and a distance.

tilla, 4 to 1 agst. Bohemian, and 5 to 1 agst. Lady Char-
lotte. At starting Why Not made running at a sorry pace,
Bohemian lying second, to the first turn, where he ran
out in the direction of the river, and was only brought
back in time to save his distance. Lady Charlotte took
his place, and kept it to the distance, where Mantilla and
Ida went by her ; the remainder of the ground was con-
tested with some spirit, Ida winning cleverly by a length.
Second beat-5 to 2 agst. Messen er; and 5 to 2 agst.
Ida. Lady Charlotte and the Muley filly made the running
till round the first turn, where it was taken up by Man-
tilla, and continued by her to the distance; Ida and Mes-
senger then ran up, but it was evident that the latter had
the race in hand ; he won easily by a length.
Third heat-2 to lon Messenger. The Hermit was
in front, with a good lead to the last turn, where Messenger
gave him the go by, and won in a canter.
The Claremont Stakes of 10 sues. each, and 25 soya.
added. The winner to be sold for 100, Etc. Heats as
before.

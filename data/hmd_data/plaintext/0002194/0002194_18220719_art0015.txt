RACE FOR A RUMP AND DOZEN.

Two Gentlemen of the names of .DEEItIIA3I and MALTA-
sox made the bet at a Coffee-house in St. James's on \Wed-
nesday night, when mellowed at the shrine of Bacchus, to run
five miles, and to start off-hand. Rattlers were procured, and
off they went to the Willsdon-road and started. The match
immediately became a sporting one between the Corinthian
followers, and it was an excellent race. Both seemed aware of
the want of condition, but they did the first mile together in six
minutes, the second in seven, and the third in eight, when the
nutritious wet oozed forth in streams. The pedestrians, how-
ever, kept on at slavery together, when Mr. DEERITAM let go
his speed in the last 100 yards, and won cleverly at last in
thirty-six minutes.

The Commemoration Fete of his MAJESTY'S
Coronation at the Royal Gardens, Vauxhall, to-
night, is said to be on a scale of splendour here-
tofore unknown in this country. All the distin-
guished and fashionable are expected on this
memorable' and loyal occasion ; and the British
public will have the proud satisfaction of wit-
nessing most of the rank, beauty, valour, and
celebrity of their country.
The plump matronly dame of an old farmer in
the weald of Sussex, who had never before, in the course of her
life, been so far from home, and who, it would seem from her
daily habits of feeding pigs, poultry, &c. had conceived the
motherly notion, that things as well as animals, required some-
thing to eat and drink, on accompanying her spouse hither,
to witness the far-famed gaiety of the town, and going with him
on board one of our phcketsfor a few hours' sail, upon observing
the water to run from one of the vessel's cuppers into a boat
that had been accidentally left along side under it, is said to
have exclaimed —" See ! sec ! measter ! measter !—Law ! ! do
see ! how natural the old one is giving the young one suck ! ! !"

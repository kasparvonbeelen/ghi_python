WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 16, 180 g.

Captain DOM, of the Pallas, arrived last night at
the Admiralty with dispatches from Sir R. STR AcH AN.
When Captain DOBIE came away on Sunday last, a
tremendous bombardment was kept up on Flushing,
and on the same evening, when at sea, the
whole horizon in that quarter was in a blaze•
Lord WILLIAM STUART, in the Lavinia, led in
a squadron of 10 frigates in grand style, between
the batteries of Flashing and Cadsand, with the
loss only of two or three inen. The line-of-battle
ships were to follow. Six French gun-boats, which
ventured down as far as Batz' grounded, and
were destroyed ; 20,000 of cur troops bad proceed-
ed as far ac Batz. Th.: net objets will be the
strong fort of Lillo, between which and Antwerp
vile are not aware they w ill meet with any obstruc-
tion from forts on the right basik of the Scheldt.
nel.t accounts must be highly interesting.

The following Letter viiis this morning received
from Margate. We shz,ll bti most happy it the state-
ment contained in the latter part of it should prove
tru2, hut we fear it is uafounded

" MARGATE, AUG.I iyed the Deft:tier gun-
brig from Walcheren ; she left Campier yesterday
tra,-rning about seven o'clock; our forces had begun
to bombard Flushing about three o'clock the same
morning, in so furious a manner that the town
seemed to be in a blaze. About the time of the
ship eettiog under weigh, some Flags, of Truce wece
pere.-ived. .A %fry heavy canuohade began again
aklol2t nine o'clock in the. evening. Admiral KTATS
was. proceedng up the West Scheldt. The pea-
aantry about Rotterdam had risen to support Ll 5, and
it wo hepc;d that Rotterdam, with three French sail
of the line at that place, would soon be M our pos-
scssioil.

We lime this tiny made some Extraas from the
liamburgli and other Foreign Papers, the arrival of
which we noticed yesterday. Our Expedition ap-
pears to have excited considerable alarm, in Holland.
The Dutch Papers gi\-o the British Government great
,for the secrecy with which it was planned,
for its destination was not known till it arrived off t,he
mouth of thc-, Scheldt.

WHever success play attend any of our national
operations, the zealots of party will be sure to. say
sOinething against Ministers ; and, if possible, to
fcy.-.(lth,ir cilirges on those very points upon which
Ministers are entitled to the approbation of their
Countky. That policy rendered it proper for us to
assist the cause of Spin, independently of all feel-
ings of generosity towards a Natiou threatened with
slavery by the common Tyrant of Europe and dis-
turber of mankind, olne will doubt ; and, that we
:Jaye done. every thing which both policy and gene-
rosity cl44pan4ed, in order to enablg a gallant people
to preserve their freedom, and secure their legi-
titnate qoverillorot, every brdy will pdmit, who
is not blinded by party feelings'; yet the Op-
position Writer at one time contend, that we
emelt to have left Spain to herself, and at another,
witi equal warmth, declare, that we have not done
encwgh to resist her. Yet the Spaniards themselves
Lave no disposition to complain, as we have most
zen:sously endeavoured to supply all their v.ants,:and
have seat powerful armies to assist them, under our
post bJe Commanders. The Spaniards, and,
deed, all Europe must flow, that. if Great Brita;n

had not come forward as- slie has done, Spain would
long sine, have been reduced to a quiet subjugation
under the French Tyrant, and would, perhaps, be
without hope of regaining her independence, even if
Providence were to deliver the world from that
odious Tyrant. We, however, have 'compelled
him to acknowledge the superiority of British
valour, and we may fairly say, of British military
-skill,—a faet, indeed, that was manifested in Egypt
and at Maida, but which has been so fully demon-
strated in the Battle of Talavera, that, with.all his
audacity, he will hardly presume to reproach us
again as being'a nation of Shop-keepers. We have
done so twach for Spain, and set her such a glorious
Example of Military Prowess and Skill, that if she
exerts herself properly, her Deliverance must be
certain. After such a glorious triumph as our gal-
lant Commander, Sir ARTHUR WELLESLEY, and his
Army of Heroes have achieved, it is hardly possible
to suppuse r hat the Spaniards will not catch fire from
British V;lour, and in conjumaion with that Valour,
etie6tually secure their independence. But she must,
indeed, bring forth all her energies, or she is gone ;
for the Tyrant will be enabled, by the unfortunate
termination of his. contest with Austria, to pour
new hordes into Spain, and it will be impossible
for Great Britain to save her, unless she is resolved
to hazard every thing °in the effort to save herself.

Yesterday morning his MAsciiTY, Princesses
GUSTA rnd SOPHIA, accompanied by Lady G. Mpa-
RAY', Honourable Mr. G. VILLIERS, Genera's EITZ-
ROY and CARTWRIGHT, and Colonel TAYLOR, rode
in the Great Park, Windsor, and returned at twelve
o'clock.

This day the Duke of YonK completes his 46th
year ; and it is ey.pe6led that the QuEEN and the
elder Princesses will cline at ()viands with the Dcke
and Duchess o► Yotztz, and celebrate the blrth of his
Royal Highness.
Yesterday afternoon a Cabinet Council was held
at the Foreign Otfice, at which were present the
LORD CHANCELLOR, Earls CATsIDEN, HARROWLY,
WESTMOV.LAND, LIVERFoar.., and BATHUEST ; Lords
MULGRAVE, CASTLEREAGH, and LEVI.;ON GOWER;
11.1 r, Secretary CANNING, and thr. CHANCELLOR of
the EXCHEQUER.

Letters of 2d August, from Cadiz, announce the
safe arrival of the Marquis Wk:t.LL6i,.}.:Y in that city.
He lancled ahnost at the instant of the receipt of the
di6patcl;e4 announcing the victory of Talavera. His
was rect.:;:ecl with heart-felt demonstra-
tions of juy. The hor,ies were taken from his car-
riage, which was drawn to the house of Mr. Dtqtr,
the British Consul, amidst the most grateful acct i-
In.AionS, to the honour of the I:srittsli army and na-
tion, our gracious Sovereign, and Sir iliqnuit WEL-
LESLEY. 41e Marci'llS WELLEst.Ey went to the
Theatre in the evening, where be sat in the Gover-
nor's hog, and was received with snuilar greetings.
The city was illuminated.
.11Tajor-General M..,cslverzr.c, who gloriously fell
in the battle of Talavera, was a Member of Parlia-
nlent for the county of Su;herland.
We are sorry to say that Sir A. WELLESLEY re-
ceived a severe contusion in the shoulder frajn a
srritt musket-ball. He had,- the good fortune, how-
ever, to escape two bullets which passed throuzli
iris cloaths.

every State depends upon public opinion. After

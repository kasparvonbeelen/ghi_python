IN RE BENNETT, A LUNATIC.

Sir EDWARD SUDDEN held in his hand two petitions—
one which prayed that the solicitors, Messrs. Austin and
Co., might be ordered to leave in the Master's-office the Lu-
natic's will,and that the Committee might be allowed to have a
copy of it; the former part of which was ordered, but the
Court directed the will to remain in the office sealed up
as it now was. The prayer of the next petition was that
part of the real estate might be ordered to be sold or mort-
gaged to enable the Committee to pay the law expenses
which had been incurred by the sueing out of the commis-
sion, &c. The lunatic was about 95 years of age, and as
probably she would not live very much longer, the better
way would be to direct a mortgage to he executed rather
than sell any part of the real estate. The next of kin
consented to a mortgage. Mortgage ordered to be executed

VICE-CHANCERY COURT.-(THIS DAY.

IN RE THE BEDFORD CHARITY.

The ATTORNEY-GENERAL replied to-day in this peti-
tion, the arguments of which have occupied the Court for
several days.
His HONOUR immediately gave judgment, dismissing
the petition with costs, cons.dering first that there was a
want of substantial ground of complaint, a want of
authority to entertain the petition at all in its present form,
and also want of general jurisdiction.

KING'S BENCH.-(THIS DAY.)

REPEAL OP THE UNION.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE SUN.

SIR,—To discuss questions purely political as
abstract principles, wholly unconnected with the
consideration of what may be the merits or de-
merits of the individual by whom they have been
submitted to the notice of the public, and to re-
gard them only as they may happen to agree with
our perceptions of general utility, is a rule from
which a writer, aspiring to be thought respectable,
will seldom think of departing. There is a mean-
ness of mind—a sordidness of soul—a poverty of
intellect—and of all that is noble, generous, great,
good, and God-like in man, in any attempt to re-
fute or ridicule opinions by exposing the faults,
frailties, or imperfections of those by whom they
were promulgated. In philosophy, there is no ne-
cessary connection between the actions and the
•entiments of any man, and nothing could exceed
the absurdity of inferring, that because the former
may be improper, the latter must be false. If,
however, the promulgator of opinions be im-
pressed with the belief, or if he wish to im-
press the belief on others, that his words,
through some- known or expected agency, will
resolve themselves into actions, then are his opinions
to be considered a portion of himself, and himself to
be identified with his opinions ; for then " of the
abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." These
observations are intended as a sort of apologetical
preface to the introduction of the subject-matter of
this letter —the GREAT AGITATOR. The question
of the Repeal of the Union is not an abstract one in
the proper acceptation of the term. It is a question,
the final settlement of which must affect the moral
and physical condition of millions; and therefore I
have a right to introduce the name, and express my
opinion of the conduct, the capacity, and the motives
of those by whom it is forced on the attention of
the country.

Daniel O'Connell, " the man of the people,"
" the liberator," " the agitator," or" the dictator,"
as be is usually and severally denominated, is one
of those remarkable characters possessing in them-
selves the stamina of physical or moral achievement.
Time, place, situation in life, and a numerous variety
of favourably concurring circumstances, have un-
doubtedly contributed largely to the elevation of
the pinnacle of celebrity on which he now stands ;
but without the aid of many of them he
would have transmitted his name to posterity. By
nature haughty, ambi tio us, enterprising, and sanguine
of success; by constitution, generous, warm, enthu-
siastic, impatient, restless, and unstable; by educa-
tion a theologian, a polemic, and a bigot ; by reflec-
tion self-willed, self-sufficient, and contemptuous of
the judgment of others ; by habit a triumvirate of
priest, agitator, arid autocrat, Daniel O'Connell is
not wanting to himself in qualities which in every
age have distinguished their possessors.
I know not if any man ever stood so long before
the public, so closely watched by all parties, whose
real character was so little known. If you ask a
member of the Trades' Union, what kind of a man
is Mr. O'Connell, he will tell you, in the most
glowing language, and with the most fervid elo-
quence, and earnestness of manner, that he is the
FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY I—the concentrated wis-
dom of SEVEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE !—that he is
BRAVE, GENEROUS, and DISINTERESTED ! HUMANE,
BENEVOLENT, and CHARITABLE! PIOUS, LIBERAL,

and LOYAL ! as GREAT as he is GOOD ! and, in a
word, a SEMI-HEROICAL, SEMI-APOSTOLICAL MODEL
of human PERFECTION ! Having parted-, with your
informant of the Trades', put the same question to
the next Conservative that crosses your path, and
the answer delivered with a stamp of the foot, a
shake of the head, and a contortion of the whole
countenance, will be the very reverse. Daniel
O'Connell, he will inform you, is a public INCEN-
DIARY—the Cataline of the State ! He will assure
you, that lie has watched his conduct for years, and
that the whole has been a commixture of cowardice,
knavery, cunning, selfishness, rebellion, bigotry,
and priest-ridden prostration of intellect. That the
" Man of the People " is a tyrant ! and that the
" Liberator" is a vile detestable demagogue ! There
is also a third party, whose opinion of Mr. O'Connell
agrees with neither of these. By those he is re-
garded in every respect as an ordinary person, ex-
cept in the matter of wisdom and foresight. Ac-
cording to them, he saw with the eye of a seer, and
delivered with the inspired tongue of a prophet, ail
that has happened to Ireland or himself since the
Union, at or immediately after the passing of that
measure. This party is hardly less numerous than
either of the others, and as they are impressed with
a belief that whatever is prophesied by Mr. O'Con-
nell will come to pass, the line of conduct which
they adopt is admirably calculated to realize his
expectations, and of course confirm their faith, as
well as add to their numbers.
That the judgment of these parties is severally
incorrect, is a proposition the truth of which will
hardly be questioned by any but themselves. Daniel
O'Connell is neither possessed of all the virtues,
disgraced by all the vices, nor gifted with any por-
tion of the prophetic spirit here attributed to him.
That no misconception may arise, I shall be as de-
finite as possible in the few remarks I am about to
offer ; and, in so far as I may be mistaken, shall be
most happy to submit to proper correction from
whatever quarter it may proceed.
The efforts which Daniel O'Connell has made to
redeem his country, as he believes, were not, in the
first instance, the result of any deep-laid scheme of
personal or family aggrandizement. In the College
of St. Omer's he had first been made sensible that
he was born with the foul mark of slavery on his

forehead—that he was an alien in the land of his

fathers—that his religion—the religion of Christ,
was proscribed, and that any labours to redeem
himself, his country, and his faith would not go
unrewarded in another world. His early studies
were of a nature to make this sink deeply
into his heart. Divinity was then considered
a necessary portion of the education of one who
was destined to spend his life in the company of
heretics, and to it the future agitator applied himself
with a zeal seldom exceeded. This first introduced
him to the notice of his countrymen, as the readers
of his disputes with parson Daly, and other celebra-
ted polemics cannot have forgotten. The law com-
pleted what the monks had already begun. Cruel
enactments, and the tyranny of a ruthless executive
Government, apparently aimed with deadly intent
at the bosom of his fellows in faith, feeling, and
suffering, determined him at all hazards to at-
tempt their freedom. Rebellion, he saw, was use-
less, and mere remonstrance equally unavailing.
Bigotry he found was confined to no Christian com-
munity, and as co-operation was necessary to obtain
the object of his longing anxious hopes, he, as far as
conscience under the dominion of an illiterate monk
would permit him, sacrificed his intolerance, and love
of religious disputation on the altar of public good.
The effect was first perceptible in the readiness with
which all parties joined the Catholic Association;
and the result of the labours of that Union, of which
he has the honour of being both the founder and
head,. is one of the most memorable victories oh-
, tamed by the force of public opinion, over besotted
bigotry, and murderous oppression, commemorated
in the history of mankind.
So far Daniel O'Connell was the father of his
country, and so far he has made Ireland his debtor
to an amount that no penny subscription can ever
repay. He may, however, yet live to cancel the
debt by inflicting evils on Ireland, from which she
may suffer as severely as she has done by the ini-
quitous laws which he was an ostensible, active
agent in having repealed. Inhaling the incense of
adulation, feeding on flattery, and never moving be-
yond the poisoned sphere of parasitical praise, he
knows not how to exist without excitement.
Neither the love of Ireland, nor the love of the
12,0001. a-year which he receives as tribute, is the
real cause of Mr. O'Connell's anxiety for a repeal of
the Union. That is to be found in his implacable
hatred of Stanley and the Government, in his newly
cherished hope that the measure, if carried, will lead
to the revival or resuscitation of the rank of his fa-
mily, which lie boasts is of Royal origin, but above

ill in his love of stirring scenes in which he will be
tEe leading actor, of commotions of which he wil
be the author, and of cheers of which he will be the
object.

As to what is said of the Repeal of the Union
being long contemplated by Mr. O'Connell, I shall
content myself with observing that there is no truth
in it. He has never proposed any measure to the
people of Ireland, with the exception of Catholic
emancipation, which engaged his attention a month
before the public were made acquainted with it.
His every measure is a mere experiment tried on
the feelings of the people, on the benefits of which
he is sure to say little until he has obtained a part)
to second him. As to the repeal, he would have
never thought of formally introducing the subject were
it not that the hints he threw out, for the evident pur-
pose of annoying Mr. Stanley, were taken up
and commented upon by the English and Irish
press. The sparks would have become instantly
extinct had not Mr. Stanley gone over to Ireland.
and, by his absurd letter to the Secretary of the
Trades' Union, his madness in enforcing tithe pro-
secutions after the British Parliament had pro-
nounced them unjust, his dismissal of Colonel Pierce
Butler from the Lieutenancy of Kilkenny, and a
thousand other wild and wicked pranks, for zhe mere
purpose of disputing the power of doing mischief
with the Dictator, fanned them into a flame, which,
spreading north and south, tvith the rapidity of
lightning, soon enveloped the country in flame.
Whatever Mr. O'Connell's sentiments may be in
his reflecting moments, he has now gone too far to
recede, nor need a hope be entertained that he will
not do his utmost to carry the Repeal by any, and
every means, promising to be attended with suc-
cess. Not only is he PLEDGED, but, according to
himself, he is SOLEMNLY SWORN not to accept any
office or appointment of trust or profit for himself
or his family, until the Parliament is again as-
sembled in College-green ! This oath he will keep
to the letter, as on its observance depends his in-
fluence over the minds of his countrymen. The
Irish in general are averse to swearing on a Prayer-
book or Missal, and would never forgive the breach
of such an oath. Yet the fact of his having so
sworn will procure him thousands of supporters
amongst the ignorant, who will consider that a pro-
ceeding so solemn will sanctify his cause !

Had Mr. O'Connell no other motive for a repeal
of the Union than the pleasure he would derive from
thwarting Stanley and the Whigs, I verily believr
he would go as vigorously to work as he is doing at
present. In his resentments he is implacable. Hr•
never pardons an injury, whether inflicted in an in-
dividual or collective capacity. Though the per-
formance of religious duties or ceremonies—of which
he is the veriest slave—or the policy of party in-
trigue, may wring from him the offer of reconcilia-
tion, and the extension of the hand of friendship
yet the heart has no share in the transaction; and
when the fitting moment arrives, he never fails to
satiate his revenge. His professed liberality and
detestation of telgious bigotry are mere Quixotism—
dreams of the imagination, in which for the time he
is himself a sincere believer; but neither the one nor
the other has an actual existence.

Be Mr. O'Connell's avowed purposes what they
may, his real object is to establish a republican
form of government in Ireland, after the model of
the United States, of which he expects to become
the President. Your readers may ridicule the idea
if they please, but that affects not the truth of this
statement. I know he denies that such is his ob-
ject ; but he does so because he is aware that many
of those who now join him in crying out "Repeal !"
would desert his standard were any intimation given
them that repeal meant more than a simple separa-
tion of the legislative body of the two countries
composing the Commons' House of Parliament.
Of the other Irish Members pledged to support
a Repeal of the Union, it may be enough in this
place to observe, that many of them will take no
active part in the advocacy of the question, unless
the obstinacy of the Government in persevering in
the ruinous line of policy which they are at present
pursuing, render such a proceeding indispensable to
the safety, security, and tranquillity of the Irish
people. Besides, such is the hauteur of Mr. O'Con-
nell, and his extreme jealousy of every one aspiring
to rival him in the affections of the people, that
few would desire to act in concert with him, were
they not compelled to do so by their constituents.
Of this knowledge it is the duty of the Government
to take the proper advantage. With the exception
of the O'Connell tribe, and that automaton pink of
servility, Ruthven, there is hardly a Member that
will suffer himself to be dragged at the chariot
wheels of the Dictator. Even the ex-secretary,
O'Dwyer, will now and then vote against him, were
it only to show the country that he is now indepen-
dent, and thinks for himself.

I stated before that O'Connell's real object in
pressing the question of repeal, was to separate
Ireland from this country, and establish a Republic.
I now challenge those who differ from me in this
opinion to give any other satisfactory reason
for the existence of such a body as the newly
organized force entitled THE IRISH VOLUNTEERS!
I shall be thankful to be told the purpose for which
men are divided into companies, under the com-
mand of persons bearing the titles of the different
officers appointed to superintend regular troops, un-
less to prepare them on some future occasion to act
the part of soldiers! If I am to believe Mr. O'Con-
nell, their business is to keep peace in the country,
by performing the duties, and superseding the ne-
cessity of police. Will any one believe this ? Or,
if it be indeed true, why ale the peasantry to be
accustomed to the presence of officers assuming the
ranks of Captains, and Majors, and Colonels, and
even Generals ? These names are unknown in a
constabulary force. The word Captain is, I be-
lieve, used in Ireland as the word Superintendent is
here, but there is no idea of military rank conveyed
in it. But, to seem unacquainted with the design
of organizing such a force, is to affect a dangerous
ignorance. The time to dispel the charm by which
they have been collected is the present, and the
way to do that is not by transporting fresh regi-
ments to Dublin, but to assure the people that their
interests are in the hands of those who will not put
them to the trouble of standing on the defensive to
obtain justice. Our wise Administration are, how-
ever, too tender of their reputation, as men who
never submit to have their motives questioned—
too fearful of being taken, for cowards—too trem-
blingly alive to the appearance of an insult to reason
with arguments, short of fixed bayonets, with
the people of Ireland ! It might be whis-
pered that they dreaded coining into collision with
Mr. O'Connell's volunteers, and therefore they
resolve to vindicate their sway by sending over an
additional military force to wring from starvation
its last morsel, from shivering widowhood her only
covering, and from half-sheltered orphanage all that
protected helpless innocence from the damps of
earth, arid the dews of heaven ! in order to vindi-
cate the right of that divine MOLOCII, the Esta-
blished Church, to human victims of every creed!
By a single act of justice the Irish volunteer as-
sociation might be for ever crushed; and yet such is
the fool-hardiness, the windmill courage of Ministers,
that rather than have it said the victory was gained
by a prudent concession of just claims, they prefer
a path tracked with blood, and seared with burning !
and which in the end may possibly lead to their
own discomfiture and disgrace ! Whatever may be
the colour of their crimes, or the tenor of their ac-
tions, the people of Ireland are becoming more and
more enlightened, so that, tf, govern them by co-
ercion would be the height of human folly.
I have heard in several respectable quarters, that
Mr. Stanley is concocting a Bill for the refor-
mation of the Irish Church, which he intends
taking an early opportunity of laying before the new
Parliament. I have also learned that the Bill con-
templates, or rather proposes, the reduction of the
Irish hierarchy, so as to assimilate that body with
their brethren in numbers. Now, if the measure
in preparation be worth the acceptance of the peo-
ple of Ireland, why was it not given them before the
dissolution of the last Parliament, as a means of

late. The same may be said of every measure in-
ended to ameliorate the condition of Ireland—the
remedies all come teo late. Besides, nothing short
rtf the total abolition of the tithes wit be of any
service. Mr. S•anley may model and remodel the
establishment, as long as he pleases, provided the bur-
lens are removed from the shoulders of the people.
But they will no longer compromise the matter.
The tithe system has become so oppressive, and the
oeople have become so sensible of the injustice of
Is existence, that we either must destroy it or sacri-
fice the country.
Before dismissing the question of tithe., it is im-
possible not to point to it as a lamentable proof
of the correctness of English notions of morality.
Thus, for instance, we say the tithes exacted from
Dissenters or Roman Catholics are an unjust impost,
and yet, with the utmost coolness imaginable, we
give orders to an army deliberately to murder
them if they attempt to resist the exaction
If asked why we do this, our answer is that
the exaction which we declared to he ini-
quitous in the first instance, being made accord°
ing to law, it was our duty to have so acted,
in order that the power of the law might ba
vindicated, but we never think that whilst we are
vindicating human, we are outraging divine law.
No, no; the part of a good Christian, and loyal sub-
ject in England is to obey the law whilst it is law ,
no matter what may be the nature of the Divine
command or ordinance with which it may clash.
As the length to which this letter has already
gone precludes the possibility of grappling with any
of the great questions that are interwoven with the
subject of the Repeal of the Union, I shall take an
early opportunity of again addressing you on the
subject. I have the honour to be, S'r,

Your most obedient servant,
London, Jan. 14. DALETH.
P. S. In my second letter, publiAhed in The Sitit
of the 11th, there is a slight inaccuracy in the sub-
stitution of" Munster" for " Muncer," as applied to
the courage of the Rev. Sir Harcourt Lees. In all
probability, the history of the celebrated German
Reforming fanatic, was, in the hurry of the moment,
forgotten by the corrector of the press. D.

THE MARKETS.-(THIS DAY).

CORN EXCHANGE.

In the past week the arrivals of all kinds of Grain were tolerably
good, and the return of Flour was considerable. The trade
continued very dull for every article during the wok. This
morning the fresh supply of Wheat was moderate, chiefly in
tender condition, and the finest samples were readily taken off
at Is. per quarter, advance, but other kinds were very dull and
nearly unsaleable. Barley is plentiful at Is. to 2s. per quarter,
cheaper. Beaus that are dry meet sale at last quotations, other
kinds are lower. Boiling Peas remain as last quoted. Grey
Peas are unaltered, but dull in sale. The Oat trade remains dull
at last quotations for most descriptions, but fine parcels have
met a tolerable free sale to-day. There is a fair trade for Flour
at last prices.

BRADFORD MARK ET.—At this market last
Tuesday, there was much business done in both goods and
wool and an advance in price was readily obtained.—
Halifax Express.

STATE OF TRADE.—The staple trade of this
county is improving, and considerably more business has
been done during last week, from which we expect a still
further improvement.—Halifax Express.

MERTHYR TYDVIL.—We learn from good
authority that the iron trade is reviving, many ironma4ters
holding at present more orders than they can execute in
due time. The price of iron has advanced same little, and
bids fair to increase still more.—Hereford Times.

ROCHDALE FIRST MARKET.—On Monday
was held what is termed the " first market." Jr was as it
generally is, rather a holyday than a market day. The
sale of flannels was not very brisk, though, under circum-
stances, not much to be complained of. The number of
persons attending the fair was very great, and the shop-
keepers as well as the publicans did considerable business.

THE SUN, LONDON, SATURDAY, JUNE 6, 1840

Corn-laws assert that their advocacy is dictated
solely by a regard for the people. The Tory policy
always has been to keep down the people, sabre
them, starve them if necessary, but above all things
keep them down. Now, forsooth, the Tories seek
to give the people good wages. They want to see
them well-fed, well-housed, and well-clothed. They
want to have them fat and independent. To be-
lieve the Tories, the whole of their past conduct must
be forgotten. The bulk of the squires and clergy
would as soon see a pest in the land as a well-fed,
well-clothed, well-housed, self-existing, bold, inde-
pendent peasantry. Their whole policy, all their
laws, have been intended to make the working
clasSes servile, and to keep them servile, and when
the Corn-law advocates profess to be the friends of
the poor, the advocates of high wages and plenty of
employment, which workmen may accept or refuse as
they please, it only shows the prodigious extent of
their hypocrisy, and how completely they are now
drivdn to condemn their own principles and prac-

tises.
Another contradiction of the same kind is to be
found in the words and conduct of Sir R. PEEL.
He lauds manufactures and commerce as the sources
of the national greatness, and votes with the land-
lords to injure, if he cannot stifle them. He proves
one day, at great length, the extreme folly and
justice of taxing one part of the community to re-
lieve another; and he votes for the Corn-laws, he
spews for the Corn-laws, which tax the bulk of
the nation to enrich the landlords. He praises
indulstry (vide his Glasgow speech), as the
only', road to eminence, and he crushes it under
an epormous tax, which at once limits enterprise
and jestows large rewards on idleness. For years
he and his party resisted every attempt to put down
the slave trade or slavery; and now, to curry favour
witl the multitude, lie must speak for a somewhat
Q,uikotic plan of civilizing Africa.
This marked discrepancy between the past con-
duct and present professions of the Tories is neither
accidentalnor temporary. It arises from the fact that
they are the advocates of error. They are the
chadipions of past ignorance—the defenders of fol-
lies !which time has exposed. The more knowledge
is extended, the more the purposes and principles of
government become accurately known, the wider
must the Tories depart from their former principles,
and condemn their former conduct, to retain the
least hold of the public esteem.
To what purpose, then, should the public now
seek to place these men in power? To give a tri-
umph to hypocrisy or to consummate tyranny ?
The Tories must either go on with society, and
must depart more and more from their principles,
always professing one thing and doing another ; or
they must adhere to their principles, must lay
aside their present hypocritical professions when
restored to power, and seek to mould society to
their; stupid errors and their brutal policy. To
maintain the Corn-laws, for example, without
muzzling the press and prohibiting lectures, is
avowed to be impossible. To muzzle the press
and prohibit itinerant lecturers, is to undermine the
foundation of social improvement. It would lead,
by a straight and short path, to the re-enactment of
all the sanguinary and cruel laws which modern
civilization has put down, for without them sedition
could not be suppressed, nor Tory policy pur-
sued‘ The restoration of the Tories to office,
whether it gave the ascendancy to hypocrisy or
tyranny, would be no better than a social suicide.

It appears now, from Mr. O'CoNNELL's let-
ter, Which we elsewhere publish, and from the va-
rious comments and statements of the Tory jour-
nals; that the late great meeting at Exeter Hall
was designed on the part of the Tories to usurp
for their party the honour of being the enemies of
slavery. They want, by declaring a theoretical
abhorrence of the thing abroad, to be allowed to
practise it at home. The meeting was founded on
that hypocrisy which distinguishes the party, and
was very properly, therefore, addressed by some of
the foremost members of the priesthood. It was
altogether a Tory assemblage, and we do not see
how Sir S. LUSHINGTON and Mr. FOWELL
BUXTON can escape the conviction of having
been either duped by their own great zeal, or of
having yvillingly lent themselves to a deep Tory
trick. Of the chairman, Mr. O'CONNELL im-
plies the latter. He says—" Notwithstanding
the many and general calls made on me to speak
during the ousiness, I declined to come forward, as
the chairman did not accede to the call ; and as,
whilst there was anything to be done, I would not
speak without the assent of the chairman, I as-
suredly had no notion of ' privateering after the
war,' by speaking after the business was con-

eluded."
The chairman, therefore, was the willing instru-
ment of this Tory principle of exclusion, greatly
to his discredit. Mr. POWELL BuxTorf may now
pray that his avowed league with the ancient
enemies of his cause, and his hostility to its long-
tried friends, do not inflict on it a severe blow,
which he may regret to the end of his life. To
destroy a well-earned reputation in a moment of
spleen, or to sacrifice it to one bad passion, al-
lowed for sorne temporary purpose to get the upper
hand of discretion, is not an unexampled occur-
rence ; and may be the fate of Mr. BUXTON, as
it has been the fate of greater men. To be the
tool of bigotry, is more degrading than to be a bigot.

The Madrid Papers are of the 28th ult. The
New Loan Bill was ready for a third reading. Mi-
nisters were in a great hurry to get the three hundred
millions of new bonds into the market, which makes a
sum equal to seven hundted millions issued in less than
a year! The outcry against these bonds was load and
general. Even the Spaniards themselves begin to
manifest a general impatience of the continuance of
such wholesale systems of swindling.
The Queen Regent was ready to set out with her
daughters to Catolonia. She was only awaiting the
news of the fall of Morella.
The 28th being the feast of the Ascension was a ho-
lyday on the Madrid Bourse.

German Papers of the latest dates have just reached
us. The following are extracts from them :•-•
BERLIN, MAY 30.—1 t is said that Lord William Rus-
sell is going to return to London, to be employed in some
other office.
Yesterday evening an express brought intelligence

Empress, which have not come by way of Warsaw, arrived
here. His Majesty other daughter the Grand Duchess
of Mecklenburg and Princess Frederick of the Nether-
lands, will likewise be here on Tuesday. Whether the
Empress Nicholas will come is uncertain. The meeting
will certainly be, on many accounts, an affecting one. It
is confidently hoped that bis Majesty's health will be cer-
tainly though slowly recovered.

The Paris Journals of Thursday, the whole of
which we have received, are filled with comments
upon Marshal VALLEE'S Report of the late campaign
in Africa, and upon the last telegraphic de-
spatches from Algiers, which appears in lyre
Sun of this day. The Constitutionnel, M. TutEas's
organ, is the only paper that does not admit
the campaign to be a complete failure, and call for
the removal of the Marshal. But even the Minis-
terial Journal defends the Marshal but weakly, and
flods no fault with those who afcn,e ;dal of incana
TlaN;r4w.iovii.ura

zainst- Mar

We do not know whether we might have been
able to reach Medeah in less time and with less loss,
but the object of the campaign has been gained ; we
have entered Medeab, and we have given a terrible
lesson to our enemies." This is altogether apologetic,
instead of being laudatory. It is worse in the mouth
of a friend than the grossest abuse in the mouth of an
enemy. But unfortunately for the military renown of
the Marshal, it is glaringly untrue. The attacks since
made by the Arabs upon the fortified camps of Ayn
Turco and Arrouch show the sort of lesson that the
Marshal taught his enemies. The glory of entering
Medeah is not worth boasting of, inasmuch as it was
found deserted by both garrison and inhabitants. There
was not even a dog left to dispUte the entrance with the
victorious Marshal. Pass we now to the comments of
the other Paris Journals upon the Marshal's report.
The National, which is always careful to respect the
feelings and prejudices of the army, of which it is the
self-constituted organ, thus speaks of the report :
"We see by the report that the Marshal lost 13 days in
marches and counter-marches, and that he was compelled,
after inexcusable attempts, to renounce a plan of campaign
out of all proportion with the means at his disposal : that
at the moment of entering the field he neither knew the
position, the number, nor the resources of the enemy—
that it was only the Bth of May, 11 days after the first
operations, and on the return of an expedition towards
Cherchell, that the Marshal saw the necessity of pro-
ceeding again towards this point to augment his forces
with 2,000 men more, renew his provisions, and to remove
the wounded; that the persuasions, and almost the autho-
rity, of the Duke d'Orleans, were necessary to decide
him to attack the Col and to march upon Medeah : and
that on the retreat he showed so little prudence, that the
heroic 17th light infantry was nearly destroyed in covering
the march of the army. Here are faults enough to tar-
nish the military renown of the Marshal, and more than
enough to convince the Ministry that the command of the
French army in Africa can no longer be confided to a man
who has so frequently compromised its glory and its safety."
Of the entire campaign the Commerce, after some
introductory remarks far from flattering to the Marshal,
says :

" It has been more destructive than any preceding cam-
paign, and has been attended with sacrifices which are far
from compensated by the advantages of the success, and
the conquest of a deserted town. The faults which have
been committed result partly from the permanent vices of
the civil and military administration in Africa, and partly
from the personal incapacity of the chief."
The ',Keck, the Quotidienne, the Gazette de France,
are equally explicit in pronouncing the incapacity of the
Marshal, whose recal we learn was resolved upon by the
Cabinet in the beginning of the week. We have not
yet learned the name of his successor, who is already
virtually, if not officially appointed.
But we can sympathise with the Marshal, who, notwith-
standing his failure, is as brave as the sword he wears.
Dreading a removal under circumstances not likely to
redound to his fame, he prematurely commenced a
campaign which he knew he must be allowed to finish,
and which he hoped would restore him, crowned with
victorious laurels, to his country. He failed ; and it
was next to impossible he should do otherwise with
such a wily enemy as ABD-EL-KaDER in the field.
Unfortunately, at the mature age of sixty-five, it is not
likely that the Marshal will ever again have an oppor-
tunity of displaying the valour which so eminently dis-
tinguished him at the fall of Constantine.
The following intelligence from Constantinople,
Alexandria, Malta, and Toulon, is from the French
Journals of Thursday :
EASTERN NEWS.
We have received Smyrna journals of the 19th of May.
The latest date from Constantinople is the 17th. The
following is an extract from a letter of that date.
" The last French packet has brought nothing positive
respecting the Oriental question, but the accounts from
Paris and London received by the same opportunity, sur-
prise us with the greatest hopes of a speedy settlement.
It is even reported that the next packet may be expected
to bring important communications on this subject; and
people speak of an approximation said to have been ef-
fected between the policy of the French and English
Cabinets, with a view of concerting with the other allied
powers the means best calculated to bring this important
dispute to a speedy termination. The Porte has been in-
formed by its representatives of the decision said to have
been come to, but nothing has publicly transpired.—Con.
stitutionnel, June 4.

TOULON, MAY 31.—Very late on Sunday evening, on
the arrival of a telegraphic despatch, the Maritime Prefect
immediately sent for M. de C. Etang, commander of the
Papin steamer, and ordered him to proceed instantly to
Algiers with the despatches just received. At 10 o'clock
in the evening the Pavia put to sea.
Pains were taken to draw the attention of the public re-
specting the mission of the Papin, by spreading reports
that it was going to Naples or to the Levant. It seems
certain, however, notwithstanding this official mystery, that
the Papin conveys to Marsh&l Vallee, orders to return.
The Ministry, it is added, will not allow another cam-
paign, till all the chances have been discussed. There is
no indication of the sending of more troops. Our army
will, therefore, remove its cantonments in and about
Algiers.
Some persons even affirm that the 2,500 men left at
Medeah will be withdrawn. on account of the difficulty of
revictualling the place.—Eclaireur de la Mediterranean.

LIVERPOOL COTTON MARKET, FRIDAY.—There has been
little change is the appearance of the market this week ;
it still wears a dull aspect, though rather more business has
been done than during last week. Prices of American de-
scription are much the same as we last reported ; the
common qualities only being a little lower. Brazils have
again declined, id. to id. per lb. Egyptian and Surats
are heavy, at last week's rates. Speculators have taken
2,100 bales of Americans; and Exporters 1,000 Ameri-
cans, and 250 Carth2genas. 2,400 Tennevelles Surat for
auction next Friday. The sales to-day are about 4,000
bales of all kinds, and the market flat.

The arrivals this morning are a French mail, and ship
Letters from Sierra Leone, Demerara, St. Helena, Mauri.
Lius, and Ceylon.

The Hamburgh mail of 2d June has arrived, bringing
;he exchanges on London, 13 6e; Gold, 431/; Metal,
108; Bank Shares, 1,868.

We may ;expect, in the course of next week, an over-
land express from India, which will bring some interest-
ing intelligence respecting our expedition to China, and
the result of the Chinese marching to Macao with 2,000
men to capture Captain Elliot; but we have no doubt he
has made his escape, or embarked on board one of the
British ships of war before they can reach him.

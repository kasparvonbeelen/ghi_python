The following note has been recommended by the Central
Board to be distributed by all the Local Boards of Health of the
Metropolis, to the Medical Gentlemen likely to be connected
with cholera cases in their parishes :

NOTE WITH RESPECT TO THE DAILY REPORTS OF

CHOLERA.
In order to prevent any misconception with respect to the na-
ture of the cases to be included in these Reports, it may be pro-
per to state, that by the word Cholera, is here to be understood a
disease characterised by the following symptoms, viz. :
A purging and vomiting of fluids, neither feculent nor bilious,
with cramps and prostration—to which, in extreme cases, are
added, a coldness and shrinking and lividity of the surface, par-
ticularly of the extremities ; with suspended pulsation at the
wrist, and suppression of urine.
It must, not, however, be supposed that the whole of these
symptoms will be found in each even of the most extreme cases;
for one or two of them are sometimes altogether absent, or so
feebly marked as not to attract particular notice. This is more es.
pecially the case with respect to young children, in whom, for in-
stance, cramps have hitherto been but seldom observed in this
country, as a well-marked symptom of cholera according to my
experience.

CITY MARKETS.-(TWO O'CLOCK.)
SUGAR.-The British Plantation market continuo very
firm at the advance noticed last week, and as the holders con-
tinue to keep back their Sugars in expectation of a further ad-
vance in prices, the business doing is limited. The deliveries
last week did not much exceed 2,200 casks. As the arrivals
however were numerous, it is anticipated that an increase of
business will occur. The general stock in the Port of London is
about 15,000 hhds., or not much above six weeks consumption.
Brown Sugars are quoted from 495. to 51s. per cwt., and five
sample from 88s. to 955. per cwt. In Foreign and East India
Sugars, little doing this morning-the Nlatket looks firm. Re-
fined Sugars are firm.
COFFEE.-The firm condition of this market, noticed at the
closing last week, has rather increased, and the total advance
from this day week may be fairly calculated at from as. to 3s. 6d.
per cwt. Coloury Brazil is worth 565., and good ordinary 535. 6d.
to 545. per cwt. The fine ordinary Jamaica's, which a fortnight
since only fetched 80s., arc now purchased at 84s. to 84s. fat per
cwt. The delivery of British Plantation for the home trade has
fallen off in the first two months of the year about 900 hhds. as
compared with the delivery in the periods of 1831 and 1830. The
exports is unusually heavy for the time of year, and the stock of
British Plantation is now only about 5,000 hhds. against 8,000 at
the same period last year.
RUM AND BRANDY.-The market for Jamaica and Lee-
wards, continues unusually brisk. On the whole, however, the
home consumption is rather fallen off, but the export demand
has increased largely. The general stock is about 28,000
puncheons. The delivery List week was again heavy for export,
•iz. about 570 puncheons, and about 370 for home use. Brandy
is worth 2d. per gallon more than at this time last week.
INDIGO.-The purchases to meet continental orders are
pretty numerous, consisting of quantities from 4s. to 4s. Gd. and
4s. Pd. per lb.
TEA SALE.-The sale proceeds very briskly. Congous are
still on sale, and realize rather higher prices than last quoted.
BALTIC PRODUCE.-There is rather more activity in this
market, and prices are at 425. 3d. to ea. 6d. per cwt. The deli-
very last week was 2,219 casks, and the stock is 18,810 casks
against 44,650 casks at this time last year. Hemp and Flax
arc steady.
THE FUR TRADE.-The sale by the Hudson's Bay Com-
pany, which closed at the end of last week, presented some re.
markable features. Fox silver skins sold from 50s. to 200 s. each,
according to quality ; black Bear from 17s. 6d. to 70s. 6d., and
some fine brown at not less than 131. 10s. each ; grey ditto at
from fis. 3d. to I3s. 7d. per cwt. ; Otter skins sold at from 21s. to
325. per skin ; Lynx, cat, from ss. to 10s, lid. The sale went
off very firmly, at advanced prices in most instances, the con-
sumption of Furs being mach increased.
In the Cotton Market there is not any material alteration.

Lord Fitzroy Somerset held a Military
Levee this day at the Horse-guards, which was numerously
attended.
Died on the 13th, in Thetford-street, May-
fair, the wife of George T. Goodenough, Esq., in the 9:3d year
of her age.
The following notice was posted on the Chapel
at Capmore, on Sunday .—" Mr. Wheeler take notice, as this
is my last warning giving you, if you don't leave this land you
may provide a coffin for yourself and family." Mr. Wheeler is
a sub-agent to Lord Stradbroke on the estate, and his father
was brutally murdered there about twelve months ago.—Tip..

CARLSRUHE, MARCH 1.-411 many circles
was the liberty of the press celebrated in the night of the 9th
February, and Ist March. In the Museum a number of per-
sons assembled. A song, composed for the occasion, was sung,
and a funeral oration.was pronounced over the censorship ;
then the funeral procession took place. The public papers ex-
press their delight at the present happy deliverance from the
slavery in which the Press was held. Our Government has
taken measures that no more Poles shall pass through Frieburg
as they have excited in that town extraordinary enthusiasm in
their favour,

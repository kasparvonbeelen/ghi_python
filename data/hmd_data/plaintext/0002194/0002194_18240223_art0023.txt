[NEW TIMES]
_ _

Our own perso-ual feelings are strongly op-
posed to the idea of the permanent, irrevocable,
and hopeless maintenance of slavery in any part
of the world, more especially under the sceptre
of a British Monarch. We are well aware that
immediate emancipation is impossible, nay, that
the attempt would be madness and ruin : yet
not the less deeply are eve impressed with the
duty of labouring for the ultimate attainment of
an object commanded by every benevolent im-
pulse, every moral principle, and every reli-
gious authority. We have taken some pains to
ascertain how far these sentiments are borne
not by a corresponding impression in the country
at large ; and we can confidently assert that the
predominant wish in all ranks of the community is
for a cautious and gradual, and perhaps distant,
but eventually certain abolition of the state of
slavery. A very large portion of the Provincial
Press, speaking probably the sense of an enlighten-
ed and respectable majority of the nation, and
without distinction of party politics, has treated
this subject in a spirit likely to lead to the hap-
piest results : " That Slavery can or will conti-
nue for ever in our Colonies," says The Sheffield
Mercury, " is impossible : no Englishman, no
Christian can wish it : and if he did, the %vial'
would be unavailing. The system is doomed to
die ; and all that we have to hope is that it may
make its exit without a struggle or convul-
sion."â€”" The object of Government is to watch
over and conduct this natural progress, so that
it may be completed without mischief to the
Blacks, or ruin to their masters" The Dorset
County Chronicle says, " His Majesty's Minis-
ters last year earnestly recommended to the
Colonial Legislatures in the West Indies such
improvements in their system as might tend ulti-
mately (hut at some very distant period) to the
extinction of slavery. Against so reasonable a
proposal the Colonists have loudly, not to say
indecorously remonstrated; but we have no doubt
the country will adhere to Ministers in the rea-
sonable and moderate views they have adopted."

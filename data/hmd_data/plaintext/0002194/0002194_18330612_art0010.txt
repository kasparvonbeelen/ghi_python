MARKET INTELLIGENCE.

LONDON MARKETS.

From the " London New Price Current" of yesterday.)

SUGAR.--There was a general improvement in the de-
mand and in the prices of Nluscovadea last week ; very
few brown Sugars were offered under 50s. The estimated
sales of last week were nearly 2,000 hhds. and tre. The
stock of West India Sugar is now 22,130 hhds. and trs.,
which is 5,043 more than last year. The stock of Mau-
ritius is 130,897 bags, being 58,862 more than last year.
The delivery of West India is 3,483 bhds. and trs., being
564 more than la't year. The delivery of Mauritius
11,570 bags, being 252 more than the corresponding
week of 1832. The Sugar market continues very firm ;
the estimated purchases this day were 1,200 bhds, and
trs., including the Barbadoes and Trinidad at public
sales ; the prices are again a shade higher. In the Re-
fined market the demand continued confined to parcels for
the home consumption, which went off a shade higher;
the sales of goods at 655. a 70s. were rather on an exten-
sive scale; they were taken by the grocers and melters.
There is no inquiry for export goods. This afternoon
the market is dull and rather lower. The refiners are
pressing the Government to allow foreign Suiars to be
refined in this country for export. The measure must
ultimately be resorted to.
Matuarmrs SUGAR.—Mauritius Sugars rose 6d. to
ls. per cwt. last week ; the sale of Friday, nearly 5,000
bags, went off particularly brisk ; a large proportion was
taken on speculation ; d imp, 465. a 48e. ; brown good,
495. a 51s. ; yellow, 525. a 565. ; white, 58s. a 59,.

COFFEE.— fhe Coffee market Was dull last week, but
there was little alteration in the prices ; a rumour was cir-
culated that an additional duty of Id. per lb. would be
imposed on British plantation descriptions, to assist in
paying the West India spoliations; the report had no effect
on the prices ; good ordinary Jamaica sold 84s. a 86s. ;

continues firm ; there are few sellers; the inquiries are
continued, but the price now demanded prevents business
to any extent. Brandy without any material alteration.
Geneva is still neglected.

of the fly having injured the Rape plant, together with
the dry weather, has advanced U. to 2/. per tun ; exten-
sive sales have been made for present and future deliveries.

on last week's quotations.

both in the demand and in the prices ; the sales by pri-
vate contract and public sales last week were nearly 7,000
bags. An improvem,nt of /id. a -Id. per lb. took place at
the public sale of Surats on Friday.
Hors.—The plant continues healthy and vigorous; the
rapidity of its growth is wonderful, six and seven inches

LONDON, WEDNESDAY EVENING. JUNE 12, 1833.

IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.

HOUSE OF LORDS, JUNF, U.

The Archbishop of CANTERBURY presented a peti-
tion from Coterbnry, praying for the reduction of the
hours of labour in factories.

Lord WYNFORD presented a petition from Gravesend
against the Gravesend Pier Bill. Also a petition from
John Beamish, late a clerk in the Navy Pay•office,
complaining of being dismissed from his situation.
The Earl of RIPON said, that in consequence of an
Act of Parliament passed last year, several persons were
discharged in order to give effect to the object of it, viz.,
a saving in the public money. This gentleman, it had
been supposed, was one of the persons who could be super-
annuated with the least prejudice to the public service.
Lord SUFFIELD presented a petition from James
White Trevor, for the total and immediate abolition of
slavery.
Lord ELLENBOROUGH said he understood that
Government had now come to an arrangement with the
East India Company; he therefore wished to know i❑
what manner it was intended to proceed with it in that
Howe—in what way it was to be communicated to their
Lordships.
Earl GREY said it was intended to proceed in the
usual manner : resolutions would be introduced into th
other House, upon which a Bill would he founded.
Those re-olutions would be communicated to that House,
or a statement would be made upon the first reading 01
the Bill.

Lord ELLENBOROUGH put the same question upon
the West India question.
Earl GREY said the same course would be pursued
with regard to that question.
The order of the day for the second reading of the
Local Jurisdiction Bill was then read.
The LORD CHANCELLOR said he had had some com-
munication with some of his Noble Friends, who intended
to take part in the discussion on that Bill, and it was
arranged that no opposition should he given to the Bill in
this stage, the discussion to be t iken on a future stage.
He would, therefore, move that it be now read a second
time.

Lord LYNDHURST said he did not rise to oppose
the second reading of the Bill, though he had a strong
opinion on its principle; but as there was an understanding
to that effect, its principle should be discussed on going
into Committee. _ _

The Bill was then read a second time, and ordered to
be committer) on Monday.
The House then adjourned.

HOUSE OF COMMONS, Je.va 11.

The SYN.:AYER took the chair a few minutes after five
o'clock.

Mr. ELLICE moved the order of the day for balloting
for the Committee on the Stafford Bribery Bill. The
ballot was then proceeded with in open House, when the
following Members were appointed :—Sir T. Fre..
mantle, Mr. Divett, Sir F. Vincent, Mr. Barnard,
Mr. L. Oliphant, Colonel Chichester, Mr. G. Finch,
Mr. W. Bolling, Mr. R. Fryer, Mr. J. Holcomb, Mr. W.
Brigstock, Mr. W. Tooke, Mr. S. Barry, Mr. R.
Macleod, Mr. T. Gadstone, Mr. T. Green, Mr. B. Lester,
Mr. C. Mirjoribanks, Mr. C. Buller, Col. Lowther, and
Mr. D. Ronayne.
The Committee then retired, for the purpose of purg-

ing the list. -
Lord OXMANTOWN rose to call the attention of the
House to the petition respecting the Dublin and Kings-
town Railway Bill, for the purpose of having it re-
ferred to a Select Committee up stairs. It was for-
tunate for him in bringing forward this subject to be
under no necessity of touching on debateable ground.
He was certain that there were facts admitted on all
hands which would be quite sufficient to induce the
House to accede to his motion for inquiry on this subject.
The facts were simply these:—ln 1831 an Act was passed
for the construction of a railway between Dublin and Kings-
town. That work was now in progress, and 75,0001. public
money had been advanced on it. It would be completed
whether this motion was agreed to or not; but the simple
question was whether it should be completed under
advantageous or very disadvantageous circumstances.
The parties had felt it necessary to apply to the House to
make changes in the line of railway laid down in 1831,
in consequence of the change of circumstances that had
taken place, and the question for the consideration of the
House was whether those circumstances would induce it
to make any alteration in the Bill. The circumstances to
which he referred were, first, that in 1831 two of the prin-
cipal proprietors departed, but since that period they had
changed their minds. In consequence of that, the line of
railway, which was circuitous before, would be altered,
considerably shortened, and a saving of several thousands
effected. After going at some length into the course the
railway, as proposed, would take, the Noble Lord con-
cluded by moving that the petition should be referred to a
Select Committee of Appeal.
Mr. O'CONNELL rose to oppose the motion. This
charter was one of the greatest bubbles ever promulgated
even in Ireland ; a greater bubble than any of the canals,
or even that of Sr. Patrick's Insurance Company, which
had ruined so many people. lle said this as Chairman of
the Committee which had sat upon the Bill. That
Committee had reported that the preamble of the
Bill was not proved, although the agent for the Bill
had had the audacity to tell the Noble Lord that it bad
been proved. What the Noble Lord ought to have done,
was to have shown that the preamble had been proved,
but he had not, because he could nut do so.—( Hear,
hear, hear.) This Company was formed, in 1830,
as a public Company, with the intention of getting the
public money ; and it was curious that in only eight days
after the passing of the Act in 1831, they had obtained an
order from the Commissioners for 75,0001. It was noto-
rious, also, that out of forty members of which the Com-
pany originally consisted, eight were stock-brokers or
notaries public. The Hon. and Learned Gentleman then
detailed the various particulars of the preambla,
and asserted that none of them had been proved.
The surveyor employed on the part of the Bill was averse
to having it known to the Committee what his charges
would be. He called this a professional secret.—(Hear,
hear.) He was not, it appeared, sent over on.account of
the first Bill—he was not imported there until after that;
but one of his first charges on this job was 7 8001.
He would say, " Heaven aid the poor subscribers." The
House should remember, too, that it was exceedingly ex-

pensive and difficult for individuals to contend against
joint stock companies such as this ; and the party who
was chiefly interested in opposing this Bill, had been
detained in town a long time at a considerable expense.
Talk of solicitation, be would say he had never been so
much solicited in his life—(He .r, hear)—and it was a
most annoying thing for Membeis to I.e so much
pressed in cases wherein they were acting as jurors. If
they were sworn, it would be then penal for them
to be so pressed. The petitioners, before the Com-
mittee, had given up, point by point, until they struck
at the shortest possible limit, in order that there
might be a Bill, and that they might have to charge
for costs against the Company at large. He com-
plained that the promoters of the Bill had published a
garbled statement of the evidence here; they had sup-
pressed four letters which formed part of the correspon-
dence, two of which were of the utmost importance. The
Members of the Committee knew the situation
of the place well, and could not be imposed upon.
For himself be would declare that it was one of the
grossest bubbles that had ever been brought into that
11. use. The second declaration of the petitioners was a
recital that the money had been subscribed. But
there was no particle of evidence in proof of that
allegation, and the Committee bad determined that the
scheme was not likely to he beneficial to the public,
nor likely to afford permanent employment on the
line of road. Indeed, unless the House felt disposed to
promote the jobbing schemes in Ireland, he could not see
how it could encourage the further progress of this mat-
ter, and satisfied with having done his duty roughly, he
should now leave the House to deal with it as was
thought fit.
Mr. W. ROCHE concurred in what hail fallen from
the Hon. and Learned Member, and thought there was no
ground for a Committee of Appeal.
Mr. J. TALBOT thought that the undertaking would
be of the greatest possible benefit. He believed that
all the most material parts of the preamble of the Bill had
been proved, though he was willing to admit that it was
not clearly proved that the required portion of
the shares had been subscribed for. One of the greatest
evils that afflicted Ireland was the want of capital Jtqd
the consequent employment of labour, and as there
bad been, in his opinion, *prima facie case wade out in

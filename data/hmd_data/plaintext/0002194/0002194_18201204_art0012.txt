Letters and Papers to the fstik, November ar,-
riv.ed on Saturday froui Naples. The utmost un-
certainty existed . there concerning the future
movements of the Austrian troops, and the deli-
berations of the CongreSs at Troppau. The tone
of the NeaPolitau Papers, meanwhile, is bold
amt threatening, and it is estithated that an Aus-
trim: invading army 'would call forth an opposing
force . of: T 30,000 men, such is the diffusion: of
the public spirit in the cause of liberty. Com-
plaints abound In -the-private letters of the inju-

their cares to increase on 'every Side the e..osotairois of your
heart... and to prevent the mortlierons fruits of absolute
power flout ever again ripening in a siniling cthintry. But in
_operations. of Aitlictilty, notwithstanding the inOst• fervent
-..eares, the generous will is 11,4 always quickly fulkmed by the
_desired &access., We participate with our constituents and
our generous Monarch, in their imilatience for the public
good.; this inspaiiebee is become our pain; and happy beyond'
iroeuSure shonlifsee tie, did the state of things permit us to an-
ticipate by the effect the wishes of
,the resuscitated nation.
But its a people who hate their chai,:s,- though the tree of
liberty springs up,,in instant all beautiful With flowers,
set its, abundant fruits do not- appear with equal selocity;
even OP Most prodiz.,,ious Works require the Se.eat of man
to take deep root; and those whom the rapidity of our it:-
5un:47(14)0 , has accustomed to wonders, might, to make
sacrifice to their country of this their generous impatiettei!,
hearing in,mind that amongst us, though the desire of litter-,
•ty is aneit2lit, the work of liberty is new ; that great things
are to lie created, and" that we, to less-o the enormity -of=
our grievances, have sworn to select with mature tel
tho,c means, whiFli- lead to natiunal •peosperity.•
Waiting therefore wit letranquillity the arrival 2t days more
prosperous and equally gloriotis, .you will not leave the state
to languish for want, of r,...oinees; by delaying fur a single
moment the payment tif those trilsutes, which are no now
longer the sacrifices :commanded by al Isittary power, belt the
pledges of natiotral liberty, the permanence of Which they
will'secnre against the' treachery tut the enemies to the public
weal. The National Parliatneot will not hare the Mot tifiea-
tints to behold a people immolating to the interest of the Mu-.
meta stilthe happinesS of the future'.
The history of the-nations, who have Preceded yen its so
glorious- a career, sufficiently informs you, that your Repre-
sentatives bave 'tot lingered in their hot; inderprize. Brit
lately the gates of the sanctuary of the lairs tv&e thrown
open; bat lately the oath ptissed with eitizenlike dignity the

lortglepottS of the Ministry have. beetr'livascl. 'lite. picture,

the state of nor coortott has ceased to lit, a secret impene-
trable to the eyes of the eititens: the opeastiods, which have
our glory and defence for their otr;eet, tirektiready knots u with.
precision. The Council of State, whi4h avail -hurtly rise up
to the assistame of the Country and the I(ing, requires our
most assiduous rare, mid yon, gaited by the fustier of a sove-
reign nation, would never pat dun its your Rept esentatives an

And while we etch to prepare the bases of a-lasting-felicity.,
it behoves you to surrotind its with lighiso hatter clay 'advance

rninistrotion, and raise it. shortly to that independence whirls
demanded by flee' Constitution and" t lie universal wish.—
We look for the menient, when the provincial slenntations
shall display, for.the relief of the commOnes,the whole pomp
of their sabliine functions, and enrich your Representatives
with those lights, which they eagerly demand. Our de-iie
cannot surely be satisfied with Irgeocraliiothins. The right of
petition is grained to every citizen by the code of our-inde-
pendence. . Employ therefore this, precious time:it) minutely

Deprive your Representatives of the painful right of saviiie

_not revealed to us all your wounds, and therefore, relief did •
nut 'cone."
. People, worthy of a liberty. nnstairied by the bloody hand
of discord, make your resurreetion every day_ more sOeudid, '
by always respecting yOurselves in the:laws, and in-the de- '
positaries4of the National Authorities'- !! Where the voice
of the Nl:teistrate is received with vetterati,,n, .whet e• dis—

that its many provincesrof the United' 'kingdom -the norther-

- which man cats pay to-his liberty r site springs up, and strikes

The Representatives of.the People should be beyond' thea-

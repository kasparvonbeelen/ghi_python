more respectable, nor more independent men in the House
of Commons than Sir Charles Wetherell, and the other
member for Boroughbridge. One of the causes alleged
for th.e necessity for Reform had been, the controul exer-
cised over the votes of the borough Members by the pro-
prietors and patrons of boroughs; but it was rather un-
fair in any of the Members of the Government to impute
to him as a wrong, a kind of controul which they them-
selves exercised over the Alembers of the Royal House-
hold. There were no Members of the House of Com-
mons whose votes were under a more complete controul
than those of the Members of the Royal Household. He
wished to ask the Noble Earl whether there was any truth
in the rumour which had gone abroad, that in the event of a
dissolution--which, however, he hoped would not take place
writs for those boroughs which were to be disfran-
chised were to be suspended? Or was it comp,tent to
any Government to do such a thing? The Noble Duke

to be any Reform at all. He
proposed that those Noble
Dukes and Marquises, and others, who had been so ready
to give up their influence over the votes of Members of the
other House, and for which readiness they had been so
lauded and flattered, should forfeit that influence. That
was a plan of Reform to which perhaps there would be
no very great objection. He wished to state, in the most
open and public manner, that he thought Reform wholly
unnecessary, and would oppose it in the most decided
manner.

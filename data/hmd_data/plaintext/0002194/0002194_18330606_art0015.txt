REMOVAL OF SMITHFIELD MARKET.

Mr. BRISCOE presented a petition from the mem-
bers and friends of an association for promoting
rational humanity towards the animal creation,
for the removal of Smithfield Market, for the
establishment of four markets in different districts
in the neighbourhood of the Metropolis, with convenient
abottoirs, and for the alteration of the market days, so
that they may not interfere with the Sabbath.â€”
(Hear, hear.) The petition was of great import-
ance, whether the House considered the health of
the metropolis, or the prevention of cruelty to animals.
He believed that not less than eleven applications had been
made to Parliament, six for the enlargement of Smithfield
Market, three for better regulating it, and two for
its absolute removal. The cruelty now observed to-
wards animals was such that he knew of instances
in which cattle bad been obliged to be killed in
the streets. As to the health of the inhabitants of the me-
tropolis, there were very great objections to the vast, though
now necessary accumulation of offal in one part of the town.
The Hon. Member also presented a petition from the in-
habitants of Croydon, praying for the abolition of the
punishment of death fur offences against property.
Colonel FOLKES presented a petition from the resident
Welshmen in London, praying that the Church Service
might be read throughout Wales in the Welch language,
and for the appointment of a Welch professorship in each
of the Universities.

Mr. SHAW presented several petitions from parts of
the county of Wicklow, against slavery.
There being no more petitions to present, the SysAm
retired at two o'clock.

RYE, Nov. 9.

Colonel Evans, the popular representative of this
rough, arrived here on Saturday the sth instant, and re-
mained with us until Tuesday, when he proceeded to
Hastings. On Monday evening there was a numerous
and very respectable meeting at the George Inn, campus, d
almost entirely of those who, under the Retortn Bill,
would possess a vote. The presence of the GOlant Cu•
lonel is a pleasure which his constituents are always
anxious to acknowledge, and they received with unfeigned
satisfaction his firm and temperate address. Little reason,
we believe, exists for the supposition that a re-action has
any where commenced, but we are perfectly convinced that no
one in his senses will pretend that any thing of the kind can
be discovered at Rye, or in its neighbourhood. The as-
surances of the Ministry that a measure of Reform, as
ample and satisfactory as the rejected Bill, shall be brought
forward, has preserved the peace of the country ; but
should the hopes of the people ever be decidedly destroyed,
we fear the Tories will no longer have to taunt them with
the patience which is blindly considered "a re-action,"

MONMOUTH.

(FROM A CORRESPONDENT.)

Passing through Monmouth in the Bristol and Liver-
pool mail, on Wednesday night last, my attention was
drawn to a house opposite to the inn, where the mail
changed horses, by tremendous cheering : curiosity in-
duced me to enter, and whilst drinking a glass of grog at
the bar, I never shall forget the scene I witnessed in a
large adjoining room ; it was filled with apparently re-
spectable tradesmen, an elderly man acting as chairman,
who appeared to be well versed in political econo:ny, and
opened the business is a speech which would not have dis-
graced any assembly. The discussion for the night was
as to the propriety of changing the name of the sign of
the house from the Wellington to the Reformers' Arms.
This was carried unanimously; next followed a vote of
thanks to the Editor of The Sun, and the landlord was
ordered to procure it regularly. A subscription was then
entered into to defray the expence of a new sign, and its
advertisement in a provincial paper, which was to be sent
you. If you have received it, you probably have had
your attention drawn to the occurrence. The feeling in
the West on the subject of Reform cannot be described.
I had commercial transactions in eight towns, but busi-
ness was totally foreign to the minds of all I came in con-
tact with. Either the holding of meetings, or the forma-
tion of political unions, engrosses all their thoughts.
Bristol presented the appearance of a sacked city ; the
smoking ruins, closed shops, the large bodies of constables,
the movement of the troops, and the terror-struck look
of the inhabitants, excited feelings of no ordinary de-
scription. Every one blames the Magistracy, and yet the
Mayor is highly spoken of. There can be little doubt but
that the Political Union were the agents that preserved
the city: the very name of Wetherell now is sufficient to
excite all the bad feelings of our nature in a Bristolian.

BIRMINGHAM, Nov. 9.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE SUN.

SIR,--1 trust I shall not be deemed presutnptious
in humbly suggesting, through the medium of your
columns, a few remarks on the celebration of the sth
November in this our loyal town. In the first place,
it has been the custom for many years to usher in
the day with ringing of bells, and at night to burn
the effigy of Guy Faux. But, oh, strange perver-
sion of fate! we had no bell ringing ; and instead of
effigies of Guy Faux, we had effigies of Bishops ;
throughout the whole of Saturday numbers were to
be seen in full canonicals carried through the
streets, and at night consigned to the flames, amidst

on the Episcopal Bench at this prospect of security
for their adored wealth. They may laugh now ;
but their mirth will be changed into melancholy, when
they once behold the people fairly in the sullen, and
the loyal virtues of passive obedience and non-re-
sistance shining forth in all their glory ; as yet it is
but a cloud speck seen in the distant horizon ; but
iis wings ate spreading, its dark hue is deepening,
destruction is arming there as in her citadel, and
vengeance is bending her brow : yes, but a little
longer, and all will be well. The peop!e shall rise
like a giant refreshed with wine ; for that adaman-
tine spot is at length found on which the Archi-
medes of Reform may plant his fixed and determined
foot, from thence, at leisure, plying his enginery in
the total subversion of tyranny, corruption, and
oppression, and pronounce to the world that Eng-
land, like America, may be stripped of a grasping
clergy without at all doing detriment to her religion,
or destroying her right to assume, or her power to
maintain, the character of a-people.
Sir, I shall not trespass further on your time, but
shall leave you to supply what may be wanting.
Hoping you will notice the above, I remain yours,

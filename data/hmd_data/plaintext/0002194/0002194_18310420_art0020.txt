'Urn. Colleague (Mr. Hunt), bad said respecting their
disapprobation of he measure.

parts, for and against the measure.
SUPPLY AND ORDNANCE ESTIMATES. •

The House resolved itself, on the motion of Mr. DExt-
SON, into a Committee of Supply and Ordnance Estimates.

Mr. HUME, who entered the House after the Com-
mittee had been formed, observed that for the first time in
his life he should not oppose the votes of certialu sums being
now passed to his Majesty for the purposes stated in those
votes, in the hope that it would enable his Majesty's Mi-
nisters very speedily to bring t',,e affairs of that House
into a state in which his Majesty might be disposed
at once to dissolve the Parliament, in order that
lion. Members might be sent hack to their constituents
for neck and neck—(Loud laughter)—as the two
p trties in that House were after two trials. It would
be perlect folly to attempt to discuss anything
of any importance. It could not be very satisfactory to
suppose that that House wasexactly divided in opinion, and
tl:at with one half the whole 01555 of the people should
be. In such a state of things it was impossible any good
could be dune.

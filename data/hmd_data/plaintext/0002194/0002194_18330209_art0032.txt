THE FUNDS.

[inent.

All parties seem most heartily tired with the procrasti-
nated debates on the address to his Majesty; and the public
in general are much pleased that it was brought to a con-
clusion early this morning, with a large majority in favour
of Ministers. Now that this important question has been dis-
posed of, another is coming on the tapis—the newly-revived
negotiations with Holland ; but when his Dutch Majesty is in-
formed of the large majority of Ministers, he will, in all pro-
bability, abate his pretensions, and come to a final adjustment.
Consols, which left off yesterday 871 A % for the Account,

HALF-PAST ONE.

It is stated that the West India merchants have solicited an
interview with Ministers, in order to be informed of their plan
for the abolition of slavery, which plan is said to please all par-
ties. They also were to beg that the West India packet should
be detained until something definitive was known on the subject.
Consols, which were done in the early part of the morning
at 87 for the Account, receded to 87i ; at present they are
871 buyers. No speculation of consequence is doing, as the
speculators are waiting to :ascertain what effect the King's
Speech had on the French Funds.

Some surprise was excited on Wednesday at
the King's Court by the arrival of Sir ROBERT PEEL• It
turned out that Sir ROBERT understood that there was a
Levee, and, on finding his mistake, did not proceed to the
presence of the KING, but returned home immediately.

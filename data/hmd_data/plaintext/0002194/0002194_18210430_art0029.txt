THE Ps EUDO-CATHOLIC BOA R I).—We have
heard it whispered that the conduct of the-niana-
-seArs at the meeting of this factious junto on the
slinst• to vote thanks to their revilers_ and en-
slavers, was of the most shameless and disgusting.
:`11(1. Previous to the commencement of the It.-
Liness, a letter was delivered into •the 'hands of
Ir. Secretary Jerningham from Dr: Poynter.
Immediately on reading it, the Secretary beckon-
ed a few of his friends, when they retired to a
corner of the room, where the letter was exhibit-
ed t° them,. and afterwards consigned to the side
Pocket of Mr. Jerningham. The business of the
Ill_eeting was instantly, brought on, and the reSQ-
utiou of thanks was passed in so hasty and inde-
ctrous a manner, that no individual present had
I.le °PPortunity of'ekamining its tenon'', or de-
l:v(11/13' his sentiments- upon- it. This having
-;n thus carried, and the. meeting on the.lioint
°a, disPersing,"the Secretary, it is-said, with much
p"roitness, recollected the' letter sent ,by Dr.'
fo°,,ter, and with many apologies and excuses
his iltB lack of memory, informed the company of
ring received:.' communication from the
w„,r4ule bishop of the district ; on which he
ly led-upon:to read it. This was according-
,..and the the substance,of it, we are informed,
„as) that as by a former.: resolution of the Board
leY Pledged themselvei not to discuss any matter
24zwhiclt the interests of religion were concerned,
allh6ittfirstconsultingithe ministers- of that as the bill then.. before Parliament contained
cla
48; materially. involving. the spiritual rights,of
the Catholic church, the prelate hoped the gentle-
,ecl " of the Board would adhere to their pi•c:iyii4S,
.rind not violate a pledge so solemnly
'Phis information occasioned those, Who.
oft re not up to the. trick, to- look like fools, and
er Staring at each other for some time, a
burs.t of indignation was. raised against the
THaded 'deception practised tipon them, .but not
toe individual amongst- them had spirit enough.
'.move that the resolutions be immediately res-
11"ded, and followed up by:one of censure on the
411, who could descend to such pitiful means to
j.':,rmy.favour with the 'leaders of -the two factions.

eeant to be substantially correct, but shoald we

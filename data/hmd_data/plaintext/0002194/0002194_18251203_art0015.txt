R'l3/ GA RDEN.-The second appearance of

tier more creditable to his talents and his judg-

illic'tich an improvement altogether as should in-

thkiLive' of his first performance. .Hamlet de-
ith's More requisites, mental and external, per-
Ilt:s than other character in the whole British
ttiir44----a depth of philoiophic reflection, oc-

SELSEY and TOURING TOY.—Laid on the table.

• Earl GROSVENOR said, that if he saw a;yremissness on
the part of his Majistv's 3linisters in carrying the gradual abo-
lition of slavery into effect, he should call the attention of their
Lordships next Session to some measure on the subject.
The Earl of ROSE BERRY presented a Petition from the
County of Linlithgow against (it was understood) the Scotch
Distilleries Bill.—Laid on the table.

EARL.M.II-ISTLIL.
Lord HOLLAND, in moving the third reading of the Bill
to authorise the Earl Marshal to exercise his functions, said
that after the sense of the House had been so clearly expressed
in favour of the measure, it would be unpardonable in him to
delay their Lordships. He therefore only repeated, that in
passing the Bill they were doing an act of grace to a most
worthy individual, and were doing it at the moment when it
must prove most acceptable.
The question was then put and agreed to unanimously, and
the Bill was read a third time, passed, and sent to the Commons

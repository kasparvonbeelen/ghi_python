LAW INTELLIGENCE.

COUR T OF EXCHEQUER, an' E
ASSAULT.—WILLIAMS V. !TALL.

The plaintiff in this case is a bookseller, carrying
on business in Paternoster-row, and the defendant
is a plumber, living in Charter-house-street, Charter-
house-square. On the 23d of November last, the
parties in the action, who had been before that time
unknown to each other, met by accident at a pub-
lic-house in Smithfield. Some conversation having
been commenced upon the subject of duelling, the
plaintiff expressed his disapprobation of the practice,
and regretted much that whe❑ he was in the army,
he had been engaged in a duel with a brother officer,
who he shot dead. He afterwards, however, s,tid
that it was fortunate for himself that he had not half
a dozen sisters, as they would probably be the cause
of his fighting so many duels, for if any man were
to insult either of them, he (the plaintiff) would
certainly challenge him. The defendant, upon this,
put a case, and supposing that the plaintiff had a
sister, and that the defendant had seduced her, be
asked the plaintiff how he should behave. To this
the plaintiff answered that he would blow out the
defendant's brains, and knock off his head. After
a little more wrangling of the same sort, the plain-
till; after having repeatedly applied a disgusting
epithet to the defendant, provoked him so much
that the latter, who has a wooden hand screwed
into a plate of iron at the end of the stump of his
arm, proceeded to unscrew the wooden part of the
limb, and assaulted the plaintiff with the remainder.
The parties fought for a considerable time, and the
plaintiff was at length carried home.
Mr. CHARLES PHILLIPS had proceeded some way
in his address to the Jury for the defence, when the
foreman, at the suggestion of his brethren, stood up,
and addressing the Court, said, well, we have heard
enough of the case to convince us that the plaintiff
ought not to get more than a farthing damages.
Here a dry old gentleman who sat in the Jury
box, and wore a pair of very large spectacles, very
quietly observed, " I beg your pardon, Mr. Fore-
man, you have not got my consent to that verdict."
After this announcement, it became necessary to
proceed with the case. When the reply had been
concluded,
The LORD CHIEF BARON said that the plaintiff
was entitled to a verdict, but that it was for the
Jury to say what damages ought to be given in such
a case.

The Jury, without observing any secrecy or re-
serve, instantly exclaimed altogether, and in a loud
voice, " A farthing ! a farthing !"
So extraordinary a method of delivering a verdict
excited a loud burst of laughter in the Court. The
case continued until half-past five o'clock.

The Lord Chief Baron will sit here again on
Monday next, and at Westminster to-morrow.

RACING OF STEAM VESSELS.

On Tuesday the Lord Mayor, accompanied by
several of the Aldermen and members of the Court
of Common Council, went to hold Courts of Con-
servancy for the counties of Kent and Essex.
The Town Clerk (Ilenry Woodthorpe, Esq.),
after ha ving sworn in the jury at the Crown and
Sceptre Tavern, in Greenwich, addressed them, by
the Lord Mayor's direction, upon the subject of the
mischievous practice of racing steam-vessels against
each other in the Thames. It was most particularly
incumbent upon the jury, which consisted ,of a num-
ber of intelligent men so situated as to be enabled
to observe what was passing on the river, to make
presentiments of such dangerous nuisances. Those
who had the controul of the steam-vessels had not
the excuse to plead that the mischief they did re-
sulted from accident, for their management was an in-
stance of the perfection at which the application of
the vast capabilities of steam had arrived. The river
was, like the public street, his Majesty's highway,
and the same caution ought to be used in it which
was required of persons pissing in the public streets.
The law required that due care should be taken ;
and if death was the consequence of the scandalous
practice now in operation, the person convicted
would have to answer for the crime of man-
slaughter, and, no doubt, would be adjudged to pay
the very heaviest penalty inflicted by law—trans-
portation for life.
The LORD MAYOR and Aldermen present stated
their determination to prosecute most rigorously
every violator of a hew which common humanity
required slemytdry onedbe of them
mostscrubeei
puiloiuntrmyatett iiieindeteir
attended to.
They
private capacities, as well as in their capacity as ma-
gistrates, of the flagrant disregard of human life ex-
hibited by the conductors of steam-vessels.
The jury were then sworn, and the court was dis-
solved. They will make their presentiments on the
next day his Lordship holds a court in the county.
At Stratford, the Essex jury were addressed to
the same effect, and with similar earnestness, on the
subject of the steam-vessels.
We undel:stand that the City Solicitor has already
been instructed to prosecute in some instances.
After the business of the conservancy was over,
the Lord Mayor gave a very elegant entertainment

to the members -of.-the corporation, and severs
visiters, at the Crown and Sceptre.
The LORD MAYOR said they were assembled after
the business of the day to commemorate one of the
ancient and respectable usages of the city of London
—that of eating and drinking together and wishing
each other well.--(A laugh.)
Alderman ANSLEY, the senior Alderman present,
complimented the Lord Mayor for the manner kr
which he had more than half gone through
mayoralty. No doubt his Lordship would continue
to show how sincere he was in the cause up to the
last hour of his mayoralty.—(A laugh.)
Amongst the other toasts given by the Lott!'
MAYOR was the health of the Chairman of the
London-bridge Committee.
Mr. JONES felt highly honoured by the unanimous
feeling expressed upon the occasion.

GENERAL MEETING OF MERCHANTS
INTERESTED IN THE WINE TRADE.

(FROM A CORRESPONDENT.)
In pursuance of a resolution of the Committee of
the Association of Wine and Spirit Merchants, held
on the 10th of June, a general meeting of merchanto
interested in the wine trade took place yesterday, al
the Commercial Sale-rooms, Mincing-lane, for the
purpose of considering whether any, and what step
should be taken relative to the proposed alteration ill
the wine duties.

At about two o'clock Mr. BOND took the. chair,
He read a report, just published, of the proceedings
of the above association,and a letter to Lord Abhor'',
which had some time since been forwarded by it,
The purport of these was to show the impolicy,
its general bearing, of the measure brought forward
during the late Parliament. He said it was a well-
known fact, that the French wine trade was in the
hands of but few individuals ; that the consumption
of that wine, in comparison with that of Spain and
Portugal, was very small ; that the alteration of the
duties would not effect any alteration of consequence
in the sale of French wine, and would materially
decrease that of the other wines; that, in conse-
quence, the revenue which it was the object of
Government to increase, would meet with a contrary
result, whilst the trade itself would be materially
injured.
Mr. Blum) should at once express his opinion,
that the measure, as in the former case, had beet)
brought forward by Government, would be &sad-
vantageous to the trade, and useles to the revenue;
and, although Government seemed resolute, yet an
appeal from the whole body of merchants connected
with al's trade he felt convinced would have its due
weight.
Mr. MooRE said, if an equalization of the duty
on wine had taken place, he had no doubt the re:ye'
nue would have been considerably benetitted
but the great error of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer was, in allowing an extension of
two years to the Cape wine merchots. To them
it would have been better to have allowed compen-
salon. Finding he (the Chancellor of the Excite-
pier) had done wrong in this particular, he did not
proceed, lie (Mr. Moore) was of opinion, that
Government should go on in this plan, including
wines from the Cape, but. riot without.

. -
The CHAIRMAN said if compensation were given
to the Cape wine-merchants, it was equally due to
the merchants generally. He thought with this they
had nothing to do. •
Mr. ADORE observed, that certain privileges had
been for a time gratued to the Cape wine-merchants,
but they ‘vere limited only to a period of five years;
so that if they had speculated upon it, they had
done so with their eyes open.
Mr. DUFF thought this meeting was not called
upon to enter on the subject of the Cape wino,
but solely to consider whether they should or not
en.::eavour to induce the Chancellor of the Exche-
quer to give up his scheme upon this subject. He
was personally of opinion no alteration should take
place.
Mr.
WILD coincided with the last speaker, and
observed that the great consumption of the trade
was in the Portuguese and Spanish wines, which
bore a proportion with those of others of 85 to the
100. This would fully convince them that by in'
creasing its price and decreasing its sale, without ill'
creasing that of the French, the measure of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer would injure rather
than benefit the revenue.

The CHAIRMAN said the Chancellor of the Exche-
quer thought the additional proposed duty on Spa-
nish and Portuguese wines was so very trifling, that
the public would not feel it. This was a point on
which he differed. The present duties were, on
French wines, is. 3d. per gallon ; those on Portu-
guese, &c., 4s. 10d. per gallon; and the proposal
was to equalize their) to ss. 6tl. per gallon, adding
Sd. to the Portuguese, &c., and taking off Is. 9d•
from the French.

Mr. SELsoN said, every cask of wine be sold in
March last was sold by ihim engaged without the
duty; for without this he could make no sales. if
France would meet this measure by a reduction of
duties on our manufactures, this might, perhaps,
give the means of increasing the consumption; but
the small reduction proposed would not have this
effect.

Mr. HAYTHORNE said there was a million in value
of British goods now in Portugal in entrepot, liable,
under present regulations, to a duty of 15 per cent.
Should this measure be carried, they would then be
b,eaking the present existing conditional treaty, and
b liable to the same duty as other nations who pay
:30 per cent.

After some further observations, it was moves
by Mr. WILD, " That the alteration of wine duties,
by the equalization of the duties of French, Spa'
nish, and Portuguese wines, would be detrintentll
to the trade, and not advantageous to the revenue.
The resolution was put, and carried by a majority
of three to one.

Another resolution was then proposed by Mr.VVILvt
and seconded, to the effect, " That this meeting take
the necessary steps to induce the Chancellor of the
Exchequer not to bring forward this measure in the
present Parliament."
This was carried unanimously; after which the
meeting retired.

Among other instances of successful wanting,
" Cslonel JOHNES, of Hafod, was offered 100,0001. for
woods he had planted for his amusement."

In the Court of King's Bench, on Thursday,
it was decided to be imperative on Magistrates to par
pauper women, born in Ireland, who have not gained
settlement in this country, to the place of their nativity;
but not so the children to which they may have give°
birth in England, who have thus secured a claim to relief
here, and who, it seems, are to be dragged from their
mothers, and confided to the parental care of the parish
officers. The separation of the child from the parent has
long been regarded as one of the foulest blots in the system,
of \Vest India slavery; and yet it seems that the laws of
" happy England" recognise a similar course in regard to
free whites, inhabiting that part of the British territory de'
nominated, par excellence," the land of freedom."

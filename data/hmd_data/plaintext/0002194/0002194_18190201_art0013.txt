13R:TISII INSTITUTION.

The Gallery in Pall ‘vas dened on'Satrir-
day for a private view of the productions of Bri-
tish genius in Painting and Sculpture, since last
season ; and it is with pride as well as plea.
sure we have to ,state, that in both respects i is
highly to the honour of our countrymen. Several
of the Pictures which appeared in the last
lion at the Itoyd h -,nhuny'are introduced in the
Gallery, and they will well reward renewed atten-
tion. But a very large majority of the Pictures
not been publicly seen before. We regret
that we have not space even to attempt to do
justice to the several proofs of talents which the
rooms contain. We cannot, however_ overlook
a very fine Picture(); The Fall of Babylon, by Mr.
MARTIN, who, we understind, is a very young
man.

The Artist has resorted to all unthO-s
rities that could furnish information, rind he has
produced a noble Work, which denotes talents and
imaiginatiou ot a rely high order.—Another Pic-
ture of a very interesting kind we most notice, as
it makes a strong impssion on the feelings. The
subject is The Return of Lotus XVIII., 1814, and
does great credit to Mr. Bien. There :ire a vast
variety of figures in this picture, and they are all
admirably in action. Among the persons intro-
duced are several distinguished characters of this
Country, who may be supposed to be present at
the scene. The Artist has with greet accuracy
given the characters of British and French features.
The French Monarch and the Duchess D'Angou-
leme are given with an expression of attention and
benevolence that considerably heighten the interest
of the piece, and render it one of the chief orna-
ments of the Gallery.—There another picture of
peculiar interest to this country, which is highly
creditable to the talents of Mr. DEVIS. The sub-
ject is Magna Cliarta. Cardinal Langton, Archbi-
shop of Canterbury, in a private meeting of some
principal Barons at London, shews them a copy of
Henry the First'sCharter, and exhorts them to insist
on the renewal and observance of it. The Artist
has very ineeniously introduced the Portraits ot
many distinguished Noblemen of the present day,
who may be supposed to bear a resemblance to
their progenitors who attended this interesting
meeting. The whole is arranged with great skill.
The likenesses are exact. The attitudes are well
varied, and the persons are .4,11 vividly alive to the
importance of the subject. There is an outline of
these two pictures annexed to the catalogue. We
shall renew our attention to this Exhibition for the
honour ot British Genius.

ORATORIO.—The Season of this sublime Enter-
tainment commented on Saturday las! at Drury.
Lane Theatre, under the judicious superin!qndauce
of Sir Gar:twit SMART. The orchestra was abun-
dantly supplied with the most eminent instru-
mental Performers, and the vocal department was
also most 'respectably' filled. The entertain-
ment was divided into three parts. consisting
of Selections from The Messiah of HANDEL, MO.
ART'S celebratedßequicm„ and BE ETHOVBN'S Mount
of Olives. The whole was ably arranged anddiver-
Sified. Madame BELLOCE-11, from the Opera
House, sung with great taste. AMBROGETTI also,
though in a scene so different from his province,
exerted himself very sur.cesqully. Mrs. SALMON,
Miss GoopaLt. and Bsudimv, were all warmly
applauded. At the cud of the first Part, Mr.
J. H. R. Mo-ri, the Inveutor 'of a new instru-
ment, stile( a sostinente piano forte, perform-
ed a fantasia ou it wi(ls great skill. The
tones of this instrument are sweet and power-
ful, hut perhaps its size and form will create ob.
stacks to its general adoption. The Theatre was
completely full, and the audience displayed Ole
warmest approbation of the whole of the enter.
tainments.

MELANCHOLY ACCIDENT.---On Saturday week,
George Rochester, living at Easington, near
Belford, was sent home by his uncle to bring him
a gun, which another person was desirous to
purchase. On his way hack, Rochester fell
in with some of his companions, who were amus-
ing themselves as soldiers. When Rochester
passed them they shouted out " the Ftenehman
was, running away ! " He immediately turned
round, and ievetling the piece, quite uncon-
scious of its being loaded, pulled the trigger, and
shot dead a fine boy, named Edward Grey,
about ten years of age. His left hand was
nearly shattered off, and some of the shot entered
his left side, and passed through his heart.
An Inquest was held 'on the body on Mon-
day se'nuight, by T. A. RussELL, Esq. and
the Jury, atter long deliberation, brought in a
verdict of Chance Medley. It appeared in evi-
dence, that the uncle, a tew days before, had been
shooting sea-fowl, and had, very imprudently,
taken home his gun without unloading it. The
Coroner severely reprimanded Lim for his unpar-
donable want of caution.—(Edinburgh Courant,
Jan. 28.)

Lord CASTLEREAGH is expected in town to-day,
from his seat, North Cray. His Lordsbip'3 health,
though considerably improved, is, we understand,
far from beidg perfectly re-established. The at.
tack of gout was a most severe one ; and at one
permed of it, fears were entertained that it might
reach :he stomach,—(Herald.)

The st4ti Regiment is to embark from Gosport
to-day for the Cape of Good Hope, and the
4th Regiment from Fort Cumberland, at
Point Beach, for the West, Indies ; the sth re.
giment • from 'Winchester, at Gosport BeaCl),
on Thursday, also for the West Indies ; and
the 9th regiment from Winchester, at Gos-
port Beach, on Wednesday, likewise for the
West Indies. Detachments 'of the following
regiments have embarked and sailed in the
Rochfort :—Sth , 10th, 26th, 2S+ b, 3'2d, and 36th,
for Gibraltar, Malta, and lonian Isles.
Captain the Hon. F. Noel, has sailed in the
Rochefort, to take the command of the Spey irt
the Mediterranean.

A new spring has been discovered at Harrogate,
which bids fair to rival Cheltenham for celebri-
ty. The wafers have been analysed by a medical
Gentleman there (who has himself received be-
nefit from them), and are found strongly to re-
semble thoQP of that fashionable town the dis-
covery is to be of great bcnefit to Htrrcgate.

FAWCETT, after returning thanks, proceed-
ed to speak Of, the objects and the present state of
the Fond; flaying described the ditlicoltics of 'the
task to per:orms in an appropriate exordium, he
Ftwee;:ed, as follows :
To this Twirl (amd mostly in this room), has
b.um .I,l).tribed, in the three prec,ecliog;years, the
;In o 41. 13s. 6il.—Not only therefore is
there a heavy debt of gratitude due from the Go-
vern:rs at'' the Institution, .but,, in my,httmble
judgment, an imperious to satisfy (as
far as may he) every contrihatorAat his inten-
tion has been thinned. Ili' the first place,then, .1,
have to communicate that not one stuffing of, the
principal has hien touched, but. the whole of this
sum has been :untied, awl the interest only applied
to the purposes of the charity, so that a subscriber
(who I presumennist be a lover of the drama) has
the satisfaction of knowing that hot only the pre-
sent race
,of Unfortunate persons dependent on this
precarious calling, but'all who follow in our path,
aslotig as this happy country enjoys her laws, and
as :long as a play contioues 'to he the rational
artinsement cif an enlightened people—l say, so
long the unfortunate-actor-benefit by hiS
li-
betality. Devotedly attached as lam to the in-
terests of this FUntb, it may be naturally suspected
that I take a partial view of the advantages likely
to,accrue from it ; but already so much more has
been achieved in the time,.. so much more substan-
tial „gootizd:vributed to our poor tri.endless bre-
thren, than 1 (tearing ridicule) dared venture
,pre-
diet at the ,begiuning of my,exertions,- that I am
now, I trust, warranted in being Jess timid in my
prOguostication. I therefore declare, that in my
view of the subject, not Only the providing for
our.-•a eel brethren, their widows -and children,
may be expected,-from this establishment, hot
the permanent foomlation will he laid for the
greriter deei'irom and respectability of •the
prOessiou-of 'an actor—so that the young and
3.isipg performer will, at his fir3t step, de-
sire 'as much advantage from the moral ,good

" From the precarious tenure by 7 which the
actor holds the ,'favour of his audience,,and the
fragile materials that ,qualify him for his employ-
ment, he soon discoi'm s that all he can make by
his calling must be tin;de in as short time as pos-
sible—this puts him upon exertions and expe-
dients that are preintlicial'to his health, add some-
tiates to his reputation. _ 'The. first is -p?oved by

Whom having been subordinates, their names

have outlived your theatrical memory ; gonie,
perhaps, may have a faint recollection of Cohbitt,.
who for many yearn has received arm annuity
from its. The lovers of pantomime will not
forget poor Follett ; his children have .been
reared, and his widow continues to receive an an-
anity from our Fund. All will remember' Mrs.
Wells (now Mrs. Sunibell) ; she receives 55/...per
annum ; and those who have attended our Thea-
tre within these last few years will have a lirely
remembrance of the veteran Murray ; at 65 he
retires, and by your assistance tie are ,enabled to
allow hint 701. per annum—for 1 wish it to be
understood, we look for nothing beyond an eco-
nomical prOvision ; but it would he derogatory to
dignity, and degrading to humanity, to see` fling
Richard- ill. begging a halfpenny in St. Paul's
Church-yard—Othelio sweeping a crossing in the-
Strand—to behold Cardinal Wolsey vetiding ap-•
pies Chating,cross—or Lady-Ma-chet,h feebly
singing ballads at Wattoloo Place. To his Royal
Ilightiess and his august Family, as deep, as gra-.
diode can be engraved on the heart, their gooil-
ness is impressed on ours.—To our Vice-Piesi-
dents, and the Company who have so.nobly se-
conded our Royal Patron, President,.aud Vice-
President (the Nince Regent, Dune of you k, and
Duke of Sussex), we ;dorm' our most grateful
thanks also, aod assure them timat whatever means
they trust to our hands shall be distributed with
ti,kiew to the comfort and support ot our indigent.
Brothers and Sisters, and for the honour of our
Profession."

The collection at the tables then commenced,
and when the result was ascertained,
Ali% FAWCETT said, the most gratifying lot that
ever fell to the Treasurer of auy Society was now
his, as he bad to anuourice that the Subscription
on this day was greater than it had ever been on
any similar occasion. The gratitude of his fire-
tren wished him to read over the names of all
the 'Contributors, but this lie thought would fa-
tigue the Company, as he firmly believed he should
have to read over the name or every individual ill
the room, He would, therefore, make short
qvork-of it' by stating the subsCription to amount.
to 15001.--(Lotid acclamations.)

Upon c".ilhe Health of the Proprietors of Co-
vent Garden Tbeatre" being drank,

Alr. El. LlAttuis returned thanks in a neat and
impressive speech. He remarked upon the diffe-
rence between the Alembers of the Theatrical o-
Jession in this ,eotintry and upon the Continent.
In each of the Continental nations, a pension was
granted by the Government for the maintenance
of decayed Pi 'formers.; but then this grant was
accompanied by the surrender of a Pe:-lormet's
independence; which surrender Alp. IL illUstrated
by the.Tecent committal to prison at Paris of two
female Performers,- because they refused to dance
a pas de deux. PAt in this li.ppy land, no such
degrading subjection belonged to the profession
of the Stage ; for here, Theistrical Perfwiners
partivipateirof the freedom of their fellor
; hut, while they'enjoyed that freedom, tie
hoped and trusted that the !iberality of their cmrint.
trymen would nut allow them to want,that.riqlief

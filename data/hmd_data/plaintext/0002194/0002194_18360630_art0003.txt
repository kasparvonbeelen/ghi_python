AMERICAN SLAVERY.—Yesterday a black man, in coarso
and ragged attire, who stated his name to be "Georgius,"
applied to Mr. CLARKSON, under the following circum—
stances :

He stated that be had just arrived in London, on board
the Matilda trading vessel, the Captain of which had given
him a passage from Antwerp, he (the applicant) having
"run" from the Tournneti, an American vessel, from Virgi-
nia, on board of which he was a slave. He was born in
Virginia, and was the property of a Mr. Vandyke, who had
slaves, and traded in them amongst the several States of
the Union. On the last occasion, having sold some slaves.
in Georgia, they went to Boston, whence Mr. Vandyke de-
termined on visiting Antwerp, where he had relatives, aft
which place applicant found an opportunity to attend.
Mr. CLARKSON inquired if he was ill-used ou board. the
Tournnett ? Applicant—No, Sir ; but in Virginia I was
beaten very much. . The slaves are treated worse than wild
dogs, and if they attempt to escape the white men shoot
them. While I was at Boston some slaves were flogged,
and they escaped on board an English vessel, when their
owners laid wait to murder them for three nights ; but the
English ship got clear off with them.
Mr. CLARKSON—But why did you come to England '? Applicant—Because I was larrupped about so much, ar.d
I wished to come to a free country. I shall be I,orturee,
I go back.
Mr. CLARKSON then directed that the app:icatit should
be relieved from the office poor box, and th At Mr. Evans,
the principal Surveyor of Thames police, slould Ind.eavour

to procure a vessel for the poor ; who expressed 11:,tn-
!lf highly delighted with the prospect of earning a suhsis-
tnlce as a free man, and sail, distressed as he was. be
would not exchune-,e his lot for slavery under cruel task-
masters in America.

LONDON,
MONDAY EVENING, APRIL 15, 1833.

Mr. STANLEY it will be seen, by the report
in another part of The Sun, was re-elected for
the northern division of Lancashire on Friday
last without opposition. The speech of the
Right Hon. Gentleman was long, but, unlike his
usual addresses in the House of Commons, full
of emptiness. Indeed, it was not to be expected
that he should unnecessarily go out of his way
to detail the plans of Government with respect
to any of the important interests committed to
his charge. The topics he principally adverted
to were, the abolition of slavery, transportation,
the Irish Coercive Bill, and the savings which
had been effected by the present Government in
the army and navy estimates. The question
of slavery the Right Hon. Gentleman leaves
just where it was, simply saying that the plan
for its abolition would be " safe and satisfactory."
Indeed, if we were inclined to criticise a sentence
dropped on the hustings, we should say that
Mr. STANLEY'S comment upon this assurance
of the Government is far from satisfactory-
" And to the words ' safe and satisfactory,' I may take
the liberty of adding, as my comment, this, that no mea-
sure ran be safe and satisfactory which is not founded in
the first place upon principles of equity and justice, and
which does not carry with it something of that derisive
and positive character which should not make it a matter
of probability, but a matter of certainty, to the people
of England, that, be it sooner or he it later, they shall
see throughout the British dominions a termination of
negro slavery."

The words " sooner or later," seem to imply
the existence of a doubt as to whether the eman-
cipation of the slaves will or will not be soon ;
but till the Ministerial plan be more clearly de-
veloped, we are content to wait in hope that it
will be of the most enlarged description. With
respect to transportation, Mr. STANLEY inti-
mated that with a view to facilitate the mitigation
of our criminal code, the treatment of convicts
sent abroad would vary according to the nature
of their offence, so that

For those offences which all but deserve the punish-
ment of death tran•portina shall be anything but a boon,
and shall be in reality one of the most aggravated and
one Of the•most appalling sentences which can be passed
upon a person short of the infliction of the punishment of
death."

Witl► respect to Mr. STANLEY'S observa-
tions on the Irish Disturbances' Bill and the
reduction of the estimates, we will content our-
selves with referring our readers to them. The
cheers with which he was universally received,
as well as the fact of there being no opposition
to his elec,ion, would seem to indicate that Mr.
STANLEY is no less popular now than when last
returned.

The Paris Papers of Friday and Saturday
have been received. They are full, as usual, of
reports and speculations respecting the affairs of
the East, but are, at the same time, so vague
and contradictory, that it is impossible to come
to any satisfactory conclusions. One thing,
however, appears certain, that on the 20th ult..
the date of the last despatches acknowledged by
the French Government to have been received from
Constantinople, the Russian fleet still continued

under the walls of the Seraglio. According to
the most recent information on the subject, the
Frankfort riots would appear to have been con-
nected with a conspiracy for a general insurrec-
tion throughout Germany, in which many of
the Polish refugees residing in France were im-
plicated. "On Easter Sunday night," says a
morning cotemporary,
" Three hundred of those brave but unhappy strangers,
principally officers, suddenly quitted the depot at Besan-
zon, and marched for Switzerland with tl‘e intention, it
was presumed, of proceeding through the cantons to Ger-
many to co-operate in a meditated revolt. A similar
movement was made on the 9th by about 50 of the refu-
gees of the same nation domiciliated at Dijon. They were,
for the most part armed, and spoke of marching towards the
Grand Duchy of Baden. On the 11th, 40 more Polish
officers quitted the same depot for the same announced des-
tination. From the depot of Salins 22 Polish officers left,
also, it is stated, for Germany ; 11 from Vesoul, and 13
from Luxeuil. In fine, a tellegraphic despatch, received
in Paris from Besanzon, announced that on the 10th
instant, at two o'clock in the afternoon, 400 Poles had
quitted the French territory, entered the canton of Berne,
and continued their march for the Grand Duchy of Baden.
The French Government had, in consequence, directed
that none of them should be permitted to re-enter France.
Those events appear to have caused considerable sensation
in the Prussian States. At Cologne, on the 4th inst.,
symptoms of revolt were observed, but immediately re-
pressed by the authorities. Considerable anxiety con-
tinued, neverthrlesq, to be entertained at Paris for the next
advises from German."

The funds declined a little in Paris on Sa-
turday last, in consequence of fears having been
entertained that a serious riot would take place
should the editor of the Tribune newspaper be
condemned by the Chamber of Deputies. The
Government, however, was well prepared with
means to put down all disturbance. The
Republican Ball, which has been so long talked
of, is, we understand, at length fixed for Sa-
turday next.

We are glad to find that Mr. G. ELLICE
has been re-elected for Coventry. The Con-
servatives made a desperate fight of it in the
person of Mr. MORGAN THOMAS, but " were
repulsed"—to quote the words of a late Oporto
military despatch—" with considerable loss." In
returning thanks, Mr. ELLICE took the oppor-
tunity of alluding, in strong and confident
terms, to the approaching extinction of Cor-
poration Monopolies. It is, indeed, high time
that these nuisances should be put a stop to,
for so long as they continue to thrive in their
present rank and unwholesome luxuriance, Re-
form (for all really practical purposes) will be
little better than a dead letter.

We find the following gratifying intelligence
in the Times of this morning :—" We are glad
to hear that Ministers will immediately bring for-
ward an ample measure of reform of the Church
of England. This will be readily taken by the
nation as a set-off against their late faults, both
of omission and commission."

It appears by American Papers that the re-
cent serious differences between the State of
South Carolina and the Congress on the subject
of the tariff have been adjusted—or rather are
in a fair way of being satisfactorily adjusted.

We do not find that up to this time any official
account has been received of the conclusion of
a treaty of peace between Turkey and Egypt,
the news of which was stated in the city on Fri-
day evening, to have been received by express
from Constantinople. The only information on
the subject which appears to have reached the
embassies was derived from the city, and we do
not know what degreee of credit that is enti-
tled to,

We learn by accounts from Oporto, to the
Ist inst., that an attempt has been made in
Paris to raise a sufficient sum for the use of the
Constitutional army, to enable it to take the
field against the Miguelites,.with a fair prospect
of reaching Lisbon. Some money has been
raised in this way, and applied to the purchase
of military stores, a portion of which has been
safely landed at Oporto.

Despatches have been received at the Belgian
Embassy, and at the Foreign-office from Brus-
sels. They do not contain any thing satisfac-
factory. The King of HOLLAND, far from
having sent instructions to M. DEDEL to comply
with the terms of negotiation prescribed by the
British and French Cabinets, persists in requiring
the guarantee of Russia, Austria, and Prussia to
the treaty which he is willing, he says, under
their auspices, to enterinto with Belgium. Now,
asßussia has declared that she will not guarantee
the performance of any obligation entered into
by Belgium ; and as Holland, for the purpose of
delay, insists upon the joint security of Russia,
although she knows that the guarantee of
Great Britain and France would be more than
sufficient to enfore the execution of the treaty,
we do not see how the Belgian question is to be
settled.

THE MORNING POST NEW MINISTRY.

The following, it is said, are some of the contemplated
Ministeiiii trrtngements. In the present critical position
of affairs the country, we believe, would hail such an Ad-
ministration as a change decidly for the better. We should
doubt, indeed, whether it is yet the moment for tie Con-
servative Statesmen of England to come to the rescue.
But, whatever our indivioual opinion may be at present
upon this question, we should feel bound to relinquish it
in deference to the high authority of the eminent Tories
included in the followine list :
Duke:of RICHMOND Prime Minister.
Lord BROUGHAM Chancellor.
Lord ABERDEEN Secretary for Foreign Affairs.
Mr. STANLEY Secretary for the Colonies.
Sir R. PEEL Secretary for the Home Department, and
Z Leader of the House of Commons.
Mr. BARING Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Sir JAMES GRAHAM Fist Lord of the Admiralty.
Mr. WYNN President of the Board of Control.
Lord WHARNCLIFFE President of the Board of Trade.
Mr. LYALL Vice.Presment of Ditto.
Sir H. HARDINGE Secretary for Ireland.
Sir R. ..... secretary at War.
Lord- MANSFIELD, HARaownir, and CARNARVON to
have offices and seats in the Cal,in,t. Messrs. SPRING
RICE, FRA NKLA ND LEWIS, HENRY HOBROUSE, and
EVELYN DENISON, for Under Secretaries.

LIVERPOOL COTTON-MARKET, APRIL 14.
—The transactions to-day are chiefly in American descrip-
tions. from Id. to Sid.. 50 Pernams, at 9hal. to 9i 1.,
and 50 Elyptians, at 9id. to 10d. ; the estimated total
being 1,500 bane's.
An influenza, to a very serious extent,
brouebt on by the late variableness of the season, now pre-
vails in the metropolis among all ranks. The Duke of
BUCKINGHAM, Lord FOLEY, Mr. HOME, and many
other persons m distinction, are labouring under the at-
tack ; while in one establishment, that of the Bank of
England, so many of the clerks are said to be on the sick
list, as very seriously to impede the business of the esta-
!)lishinent. It will be seen, by our dramatic nom es,
that " the business of the stage" has been impeded by the
same causes in several instances.

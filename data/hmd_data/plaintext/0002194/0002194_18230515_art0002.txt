PARLIAMENT,

HOUSE OF LORDS, MAY 14.

Sir T. LETHBRIDGE, Mr. Brria, and other Members of
the House of Commons, brought up the Bermondsey Gas-
light, and various other private Bills, which were read a first
time.
The Bishop of GLOUCESTER presented three petitions
from the inhabitants of Gloucester, Stroud, and Stonehouse, in
favour of the abolition of slavery.
Earl GROSVENOR presented a petition from the merchants
and traders of the city of Chester against the Insolvent Debtors'
Act. On presenting it, his Lordship took the opportunity of
observing, in addition to what he had stated on a former occa-
sion, that to prevent the traffic in slaves the most effectual Atcp
would he the abolition of slavery in the British Colonies.
The Earl of DONOUGHMORE presented a petition from
the treasurers of counties in Ireland, praying for an adequate
remuneration for executing the duties of the office. His Lord-
ship, on presenting the petition, stated that a Bill had been sent
up from the other House of Parliament on the subject of county
treasurers, which contained a clause that had, as he was in-
formed, been proposed in the Committee, but was thrown out
on the report; yet that clause so thrown out stood in the en-
grossed Bill which was on their Lordships' table. He perceived
that the votes of the other House corroborated the information
which he had received.

The LORD CHANCELLOR apprehended there were two
modes of proceeding. It was clear the House could not correct
a Bill sent up from the Commons on the authority of the votes,
which might themselves be incorrect. When the Bill was con-
sidered, their Lordships might, if they thought fit, reject the
clause; or they might strike it out on a representation from the
other House, that the clause had crept in by mistake.
The Earl of DONOUGHMORE said, that was the object
he had in view i • in the interim he would move that the order
fOr the committal of the Bill should be discharged, which was
agreed to.
The several petitions were ordered to lie on the table. The
Quorum Magistrates and Union Duties Bills went through
Committees, and were reported without amendments.-:—,Ad-
joumed till to-morrow.

STRAND THEATRE.

Don Giovanni in London was produced at this little theatre
last night, and introduced to the London boards, in the part
of its hero, a young lady named Byron, and an excellent re-
presentative she was of the gay deceiver. Miss Byron is a
blonde—has a pretty and very agreeable face, made to sparkle
with the pleasantry of comedy, and a graceful figure. She
has also a voice of good compass and quality, remarkable par-
ticularly for its contralto notes. She sings with taste and
animated expression, in so much that she only requires study
under a:Liverati or Crevelli to become a really valuable operatic
singer. For her own sake we should hope that she has not
abandoned schooling, in order to give herself up wholly to the
gratifications of a brilliant opening career at a minor theatre.
Miss Byron is no novice on the stage—her acting is of the true
Euphrosyne style—light, laughing, easy and buoyant. In the
well-known song " Day has gone down" she was warmly en-
cored, and in every respect her performance was most flatter-
ingly received.

At the close of the performance of Don Giovanni, last
evening, at the Strand Theatre, in which Miss Byron made
her debut as the hero, the following impromptu, written in
pencil, was thrown on the stage :
Charming, lovely, sweet Miss Byron,
When you put the male attire on,
Who can see your witching carney,
And not admire e'en " Don Giovanni."
But recollect there's a fair Syren,
Another Don, quite a la " Byron;"
And when you'd represent a new one,
Prithee don't forget " Don Juan."

PORTSMOUTH.

The Tories celebrated their success in South Hants, in
returning their members Messrs. Fleming and Compton,
by giving them a dinner on Tuesday at the Beneficial So-
ciety's Hall in Portsea. This was one of a series of dinners
which are given throughout South Hants, in each district ;
the Gosport and Fareham one takes place to-morrow at
Gosport A great deal had been talked-of respecting this
Portsea dinner : it was to be a marked event, which, in
the future history of the locality, was to have an unheard-of
weight in the local influence. Great preparations were
therefore made to get up a procession to meet the success-
ful candidates at a distance of four miles from the town ;
their friends and hirelings were assembled by advertise-
ment, and from these a special committee of six, including
a Naval Baronet who has ratted with the change of Ad-
ministration, and a printer who has changed over with the
set of the tide, advanced half a mile still further on the
road to meet the candidates, and met them accordingly,
and the whole procession was arranged at Hilsea Green,
which is three miles and a half frem Portsmouth. The
day was fine, but cold ; and we rejoice that neither Mrs.
Fleming nor Mrs. Compton were present, though the
Portsmouth populace had been promised such a treat.
These ladies, much to their credit, wisely, discreetly, and
matronly, kept away, and gave at once an instance of their
good taste and womanly feeling. The procession was cer-
tainly a long one ; it comprised two bands of music, and
about fifty flags and streamers. First came the two con-
ductors with twelve flags, followed by a band of music ;
then about 300 noisy fellows (not an elector among them),
who joined the party in hopes of some porter or a half-
crown ticket, hundreds of which were freely disposed of ;
then came the fortunate Tory Members, followed by about
150 persons and boys, on horses and ponies, with a second
band of music, interspersed with flags ; and the procession
closed with about fifty vehicles, of which five were drawn
by four horses, one of which contained the boys of a pre-
paratory school here. Though the procession was long, it
was spiritless ; not a single cheer could they raise from the
thousands of spectators through whom it passed—all the
hurraing was among themselves ! At the halfway houses
some of the Reformers had formed arches of Rats across
the road, with men with brooms (Brougham) in their hands
endeavouring to sweep them away ; in other places, owls
were discovered in ivy bushes (the ivy was the Tory em-
blem). Large placards of the relative numbers of the
Reformers and the Tories in the New Parliament were
hung across the streets, and loud cries of " Three Rats
for a guinea !" incessantly shouted. This alluded to
the seven-shilling refreshment tickets liberally given at
the last election, and which dirty bribe bought several
freehold votes, to the shame of such constituents be it
spoken; The whole party perambulated the town
and suburbs, and the members addressed the mob in the
square. A dinner followed upon this, at which Daniel
Grigg Hewitt, Esq., presided, and at which were present
the South Hants County Members ; Mr. Hay, Member for
Southampton ; Mr Price, Member for Sandwich ; Sir
Harry Burrard Neale ; Sir Lucius Curtis ; and about 150
other gentlemen. It is needless to say, the dinner passed
off well. They were all of the same opinion ; and there-
fore nothing occurred to interrupt the harmony. Plenty of
speeches were exhibited, applauding the present Govern-
ment and deprecating the past. Mr. Price, the Member of
Parliament for Sandwich, was particularly eloquent, and the
worthy Chairman never sung " Paddy Cary" in better style
than he did in the course of the evening. Only one per-
sonality occurred during the evening, and that was on the
occasion of the health of the neighbouring clergy being
proposed, when a gentleman, Mr. J. N. Robinson, inter-
posed, and requested of the Chairman that the two Mr.
Henvilles might be excepted from this toast. These gentle-
men are brothers ; one is a Whin, the other is of no party ;
but, because they had not joined the Tories, Mr. Robinson
wished them put under ban. His proposition found no
seconder, and the clergy universally of the neighbourhood,
as they deserve to be, were toasted with loud cheers. A
good joke occurred in the town. A Tory tailor, who had
determined to dine with the party, and who lives in the
market-place, shut up his shop at four o'clock in the after-
noon ; his friends consequently wrote on his shutters in
chalk, " Not dead, but gone to be stuffed !"

One of the consequences of slavery is to produce
fatalism. Most negroes are fatalists. " When my hour is
come I die," said one of them, on being asked his opinion of
life and death ; " it is, therefore, immaterial what I do."

THE SUN, LONDON, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1835.

ment of the Bank. The total amount of cash that has
passed through the hands of the Bank during the last year
was 7,694,896,000 francs, being 185,451,000 francs more
than during 1833. The maximum of the funds in the trea-
sury of the Bank during the last year was 180,814,600
francs, and the minimum 119,304,000 francs, but this last
was only for a very short period. The maximum of Bank
notes in circulation was 222,284,000 francs, and the mini-
mum 192,358,000 francs. It was further stated, that out
of the notes issued by the Bank since the time of its institu-
tion, amounting to 1,208,900,000 francs, there had been re-
turned and cancelled notes to the amount of 956,000,000
francs, leaving still outstanding notes to the amount of
252,500,000 francs. Of these last, 39,543,500 francs
only were old bills, 61,424,000 francs are in duplicate
bills, and 151,532,500 francs in the new bills, which
were first issued. in September 1831. Out of the notes
to the amount of 336,000,000 francs issued by the Bank
during the first fifteen years of its existence, there re-
mained outstanding only to the amount of 600,000 francs,
the greater part of which may be considered as having been
totally lost or destroyed, and therefore unlikely to be ever
presented for payment. As to forged bills, it has been as-
certained that, during the whole of the 32 years, they had
not exceeded in amount 80,000 francs, part of which had
been paid by the Bank in order to enable it to prosecute
the forgers, and limit this species of fraud. The 67,900
Bank shares were, at the end of tile year, in the hands of
3,876 proprietors. The total amount of the transactions
of the Bank during the year was 7,694,896,151 francs ;
namely, in notes 4,080,676,500 francs, in specie 640,981,474
francs, and in checks or drafts 2,973,238,177 francs. In
order to destroy all apprehension of an increase in the ex-
penses of the establishment, the following statement was
made :—ln 1829, these expenses were 952,105 francs 40
cents. In 1830, on account of the crisis, they rose to
1,021,012 francs 56 cents. In 1831 they fell to 963,743
francs 31 cents. In 1832, to 936,961 francs 33 cents. In
1833, to 914,573" francs 90 cents, and in 1834, to 906,476
francs 81 cents. The general meeting then re-elected M.
Moreau, Censor for the ensuing three years, and Messrs.
Cottier, Mallet, and Lafond, Regents for the ensuing five
years.
PARIS, FEB. 9.—The regiments of provincial militia in
garrison in Andalusia have begun their march towards the
North, whither it seems resolved to send reinforcements.
It was reported on 'Change that the letters from the
frontier announced that Elisondo was really relieved and
re-victualled, as the Moniteur had stated. It was on the
4th or sth that the movement of the Queens troops took
place, and it -is added that they had passed through the
French territory to execute their operations with success.
We relate this latter circumstance without answering for
its truth.

PARIS, FEE. IO.—A dispatch from Bayonne, dated Feb.
7, announces that on the 4th of this month, Mina sent 600
men to occupy and fortify Lumbier. The first division is
gone into Castille to hinder the incursions of the Biscayons
and Alavese.— Ilioniteur.

(Lumbier is a small town to the east of Pampeluna, on
the frontiers of Aragon, and of some importance on account
of its position.)
BAYONNE, FEB. s.—On the approach of the column of
General Mina's reserve, commanded by Orana, which
entered Elisondo on the 3d of this month, the Carlists
who blockaded the place retreated. However,. Don Francis
Asura, Captain of the Chapelgoris, who was in the Al-
dudes (in France) with 30 soldiers, found it impossible to
go to Elisondo.
General Mina has caused a bando to be published
throughout the kingdom of Navarre to announce that
every muleteer who shall convey exports from France to
the Carlists shall be shot on the spot. We know from
good authority that several of these muleteers are known
to have conveyed letters to the Carlists. In Guipuscoa
and Alava the Carlists have made a forced levy of 2,500
young men, who were immediately armed. Zumalacarreguy,
with ten battalions of Navarre, and Alava and his cavalry,
occupied on the Ist of this month the village of Orgin, a
league from Logorno.
Letters from the frontier of Spain of the sth say that
Orana after he had relieved Elisondo, proceeded on the 4th
to St. Esteban, and drove out the junta of Navarre, which
retreated to Yansi. On the same day, a column of the
Queen's troops destroyed the forge and manufactory of
arms which the Carlists had at Donna Maria. There was
a report at Bayonne, of an action on the 31st, between ten
battalions of Zumalacarreguy's and the divisions of Lorenzo ;
but neither the result of the battle, nor the place where it

took place was known. These letters contradict the ac-
count of the taking of Bergara, Reynosa, and Maestu, by

the Carlists.—Bonssens.

Our correspondent at Bayonne writes to us, on the 6th
of Feb.—" We have just received from St. Sebastian the
following bulletin ;—‘ Brigadier Iriarte has just had an ac-
tion with the insurgent leader Castor, in the valley of Mena,
near Barranga, in which the latter lost sixty men killed and
seventy prisoners, besides some waggons with corn and other
necessaries.' "—Messager, Feb. 10.

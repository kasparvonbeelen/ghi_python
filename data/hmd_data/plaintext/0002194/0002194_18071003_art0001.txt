,The House of .Saxony has recovered, -at the
end of fifty years, the independence which she hud
lost:"

The world cannot hare forgotten, that when-Buo.
NAP4rera forced the King a Prussia into war, in
1006, he pretended that Sax.ony, enslaved by Prus-
sia, was,drivento take tip arms contrary to her own
inclinations, and that the °hied of his expeditioa
was to &liver Jre ,trom the Prussian yoke.

having left Saion'y opp.n, to all the Inmalts of her

novel triode of „kubjeaing her neighbours to her

BuoFAnaTE, then, could have no expeaation of
misleading any one, when, in 1806, lie declared that
Saxony was enslaved since he was _Well aware of
the. impossibility of deceiving a sitlaio soul in a cir
,
cumstance so notoriously untrue. But he knew-the
eharaaer of the Eleaor of Saxony, arid was deSirous
of paving the way for his defeaion and submission,
I?y"l2enevolently and timely furnishing hint with an
aNlogy, a pretext, for pre3erving iris political exist-

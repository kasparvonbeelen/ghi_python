It can be proved that the profits of cultivating Sugar in
India, by the employment of the Hill Coolies in their own
country, instead of transporting them to the Mauritius, or
other 13ritish colonies, wilt be newly cent. per cent., while the
adoption of the system ea a large scale will tend more to the
abolition of slavery, both open and covert, than any other
practical plan yet adopted.
The Shares are made of small amount, in order that the
greatest possible number of the Grocers especially may be able
to possess them, and thus be interested in the sale of Sugar
produced by free-labour.
Prospectuses, with Estimates and the names of the Directors,
and any further particulars, may be had on application to
either of the Secretaries or the Solicitars.

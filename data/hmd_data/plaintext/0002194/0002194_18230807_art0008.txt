At a General CoOrt-rtiartial
the 18t October,- held at OnrriljetY,
i10118E•GUAll DS; 'JULY 214 1823.
on
1822, Liententun-Colonel William ROW-
son, of his Majesty's 24th Regiment of Foot, was brought to
trial On the following charges, preferred by order of the Alost
Ist. , For conduct incornpatible
traducing
Noble the Commander in Chiet in Indiit, viz.:--
with the duty of an Officer, in
the
,Govern met under which his Aliktesty's orders
had placed hini, by describing and charactcrihing 4 public reso.
!talon and measure of that (}aver rent, relatiVe to Lieutenant.
Colonel Robison, u Military Officer, as r.an unwarrantable
tyrannical exercise of authority; which reduces every officer in
India to a state of slavery equal to that of the, gen denten in 'the
Russian service;" the above malignant expressions forming
part of the first paragraph of a letter, dated 9th June, 1022,
addressed anti sent by Lieutenant-Colonel Robison t 9, and re.
ceived by, the secretaryG
Chief secretary to the Supreme overnment,l
and in winch, instead of of any explanation of him con-
duct, or soliciting any retires's', he declares, that '.he does not
entertain the small:,st hope of justice at redress front a Govern-I

went "capable of acting as the. Government (as he therein al.
leges) had acted towards him."
N. For having pninted insulting and scandalous remarks at
th.o, head of .the. Supreme.. Government, who was at the same
time Lieut.-Colonel liohison'a Mitlitary Commander in Cider.
:in 'the eighth paragraph of the Above letter; and in particular
in hotting, that he hoped the head of the Government would
promulgate that it is resolved to turn any, Officer out of the
country, at twenty-four hours notice, who dares to publish a,
single .comment or sentiment upon public affairs, displeasing to
them, no .matter what motives actuated him : if the'Govern.
ment fancy it contains the least offensive matter, the writer
shall be turned out of his house and quarters, like a dog with
.the Mange, at the point of the bayonet, and left, sick or well,
ready or not ready, tu march dr and GiTpb4rk for Europe, if the
sea coast be seven-hundred miles distant." ,•.
3d. For abusiye. and grosily insubordinate language applied
to, and highly reflecting on, , the Commander-in-Chief, in the
10th and 11th paragraphs of the above letter, charging the
on cunander-in-Chief with " taking to hirneelf the peculiar
merit of inflieting on him (Lieutenant-Colonel Robison) truly
despotic, degrading, and , inhuman :measures," and accusing
the Cenunander-in-Chief of, ",more inconsistencies, acts of in-
justice,.. and barefaced abuses • of power and patronage, during
his conmund of the Army in India, than are to be found in
the annale of military transactions for fifty years before he
eamevut to hdlg.!' _ .

Whereupon the Court passed the following sentince;—
" The Court having maturely weighed and cons:tiered all
that has been adduced in support of the prosecution, las well as
what has been brought forward on, the defence,.are of opinion,
that the prisoner, Lieutenant-Cokinel- William Robison. of his
Majesty's 24th Regiment, is Guilty of all and every part of the
charges preferred against him, with the exception of the word
scant/Wow, contained in the second charge, of which they do
' therefore acquit him."
" The Court having found the prisonerfluilty, as above spe.
.cifieti, do therefore adjudge him, the said Lieut.-Celonel, Wm.
Robison, to be reprimanded in such manner as the Officer ap.
Proving this sentence may think proper.
." nte Court are induced to award this lenient sentence in
eqiiisegitioce of Lieut.-Colonel Wm. Robison's long and meri-
torious services, and the high character which he has produced
On his defence.' front the, Late Governor-General, es a confiden-
tial. Servant ofGoverninent." . •
Adverting to the native of this case, as it appears on the face
of the proceedings,and to. the character of the charges, of which
Lieut.-Celonel Robison was found guilty, the King was pleased
to directrtliet,theVornmander-in-Chiet should promulgate to
theilrinkTlia liajetity's sentiments upon the inadequate and in-
consistent sentence Of the COurt, with reference to offences of
whit* they bad found the .prisoner guilty ; and which were
equally a violation „of the disCipline of the army, as they were a
breach of thaVetirence End respect, due to the distinguished
Nobleman placed in, thelhigh station of Governor-General, and
Cominander-m,chief
Upon these ground* the Cosninaader in Chief deems it essen-
tial; notwithstanding the,deithof Lieutenant-Colonel Robison,
which occurred on the niassige from India, to make known
these, his Majesty's sentiments, in order tO,maintain that disci.
pline and subordination so essential to
•the interests and credit
of the army at large, and to check idy itteniptmadeby inferior
Officers to set i.high authorfty. at defiance, and to insult those
who administer command in his Majcify's naive.
His Alajesty was pleased to observe, that no instance could
' occur wherein a spirit of insubordination, and of contempt
' for Supericir authoritY, had been carried tb greater length
than upon the occasion which gave rise to this Court
Martial, nor apy instance in which the sentence of a Court
Martial has been more calculated to encourage, rather than to
repress, the recurrence of crimes of a nature engrave, and of a
tendency so dangerous to the Army ; for the rink and long tier.
.vices of,Lieutemine.Colonel Robison, instead of afar ling a plea
for the lenient;.'daogerous, and improper feeling akewn by the
Putt towards hini personally, ought to have been deemed by
them, in the excitable of their duty, a strong aggravation Of an
ofibnce againsttliscipline—so extensive in its evil tendency-7

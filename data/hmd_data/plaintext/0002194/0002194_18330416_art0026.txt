NEGRO SLAVERY.-IRISH CHURCH.

Mr. HOLDSWORTH presented a petition from the
parish of Bradford, in Nottinghamshire, praying for the
immediate abolition of negro slavery.
Mr. METHUEN presented petitions for the immediate
emanicipation of the colonial slaves, from Alilksham,
Market Lavender, West Lavender, and other places. Also
a petition from the Archdeacon and others, clergymen
and members of the Established Church in the division of
the county of Wilts he had the honour to represent. They
think the Irish Church Reform Bill calculated to under-
mine the security of all property, and to inflict a fatal
blow on the Protestant religion. As be completely
&tiered with the petitioners, and thought thl.. Bill
calculated to support and maintain the Protestant church
and religion, he sbou'd give it his vote ; but he was
indured to acknowledge that the petitioners were most
liberal and enlightened in their general political princip'es.
Sir R. INGLIS presented similar petitions from the
Archdeaconry of Sidney, and a parish in the diocese of
Cashel.

Mr. C BULLER presented petitions praying for the
aboitton of slavery, from E ,st and West Looe, and from
Lidreard. in the county of Cornwall.
Mr. R. WASON presented two petitions from the con-
gregitions assembling at St. Nicholls-street, and Derry_
lane, Ipswich, praying for the abolition of slavery.
Mr. CHILDER presented petitions from certain Wes-
leyan methodic-s in a parish in the county of Cambridge,
to the same effect.

On the motion of Mr. SANDFORD, the Exeter Water
Works Bill was read a third time and passed
Mr. E. DENNISON presented a petition from a Mi
nister and congregation of Protest int dissenters in Belfast,
in favour of the better observance of the Sabbath.

Mr. HUME presented a petition from the hand-loom
weavers i❑ Newtown, Ayrshire,' complaining of their dis-
tressed condition, and praying for the establishment of a
general hoard over the kingdom, for the regulation of their
prices. The Hon. Member expressed his sympathy for
their distress, but could not see how the prouosed boird,
however cJnstituted, could relieve them. There was no
mole of giving relief to the working dosses, except takin4
off the taxes on the necessaries of life, and the other im-
posts which pressed most heavily on the productive classes.
The Hon. M,m.ier also presented a petition from Samuel
Chase, 11,yawatcr, against any alteration in the Beer Bill,
and from Toomas RoAnson, Paddington, and another in-
dividual, to the some ff et. _ .

winners at Newmarket last week are in any force. The odds at
the finish averaged as under :

THE INFLUENZA.—The prevailing illness in
the metropolis is not likely to decrease until there is a fa-
vourable change in the weather ; but though the epidemic
complaint attacks the patient with great severity, it is
consolatory to know that there is scarcely an instance of
its having proved fatal, except where the person attacked
is of a feeble and consumptive habit, or an exhausted con-
stitution. Yesterday there were the extraordinary number
of ninety-four clerks in the Bank suffering under the In-
fluensa. The person attacked should immediately co to
bed, having the bed previously warmed, and drink vinegar
or wine whey, and promote perspiration as much as pos-
sible, which will soon give relief ; but the best thing the
patient can do id, not to trifle with the complaint, but have
recourse to skilful medical aid immediately.
For the last few days the German and the
French papers have been full of recitals of what is called
"Riots at Frankfort." For the details of that movement,
I refer you to the German and French journals. It was
an insurrectionary effort—it was hastened on by the in-
tention being discovered at 11Idyence—it failed, because it
was pressed on too rapidly—and it was pressed on rapidly
because it was found out beforehand. Some lives were
lost—some brave young men were wounded and Idled, and
the effort has failed. But this failure is of scarcely any
importance. It was never intended to be more than a
specimen—a warning—a signal. It had extensive rarni-
&cations, which are untouched—undiscovered—and are to
the despots and their agents unknown. If the confedera-
tion thinks it bas gained any important victory, it is sadly
mistaken. If the confe,leration will not take this "hint"
as it is intended, so much the worse for the petty Princes
of that part of Europe. The movement will go on ! In-
surrections will break out! The p ople will not yield !
The mass mid not be discouraged ! If the Confederation
shall persist in its plans, tl,e Confederation will he de-
feated. The people demand a free Press, liberal Constitu-
tions, a Nati•tndl Tribune, and lithe indepentledee of Po-
land. All of these benefits the people cf. Germany will
obtain. You may swear to that. If the Princes of Ger-
ni.,ny will not come to terms nith the people, why, the
people " will send them or. their travels".—for "coute qui
coute," Germany w iii be free !! 0. P. Q.
THE GRAPHIC SOCIETY.—The first con-
versazione of a society of artists under this name, and con-
sisting of one hundred eminent painters, sculptors, archi-
teets, and engravers, took place at the Adelaide Rooms on
Thursday evening. There are to be six monthly meetings,
and every member is to have the privilege of introducing

One of the hotels in the vicinity of Grosvenor-
square was in a state of preparation last week to receive
ois Ro)al Highness the Duke of ORLEANS and suite, tvho
were expected to arrive in town on Thursday from Paris;
hut it is now understood that the Duke has postponed his
visit to Eng landLtill next month.

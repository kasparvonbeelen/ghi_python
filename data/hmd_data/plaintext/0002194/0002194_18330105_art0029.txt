of the overflowings of charity, brotherly
love, and the " milk of human kindness." We
will not believe that any thing more is neces-
sary than to make the facts known, in order to
unite all classes and descriptions of men in this
country in one common effort to put an end to a
system so full of wickedness and disgrace and
danger. It is a crime for the present, and the
menace of a terrible future, to the land which
permits it to exist for a day, after its existence
shall have been generally known. And it shall
be generally known that here in England there
are thcaishnds upon thousands of helpless and
forlorn children compelled to work for fourteen,
sixteen, and even eighteen hours out of the twenty-
four at the most exhausting and unwholesome em-
ployments, to the certain destruction of their health,
to the titter rui❑ of their minds, to the entire
depravation of their morals ; that these children
of poverty and wretchedness are condemned by
myriads to premature vice and premature de-
bility, for no other end than to enable certain
master manufacturers to send to market a few
articles of use or luxury at a price somewhat
lower (for even this is problematical) than they
would otherwise be enable to supply them.
Here is an opportunity for those who have so
long and strenuously exerted themselves to im-
prove the situation and to break the chains of
the slaves in the West Indies to show to the
world that they have not been actuated by feelings
of morbid sensibility, or stimulated merely by
the desire of a party triumph. Let those who
are sincere in their hatred of slavery, as such,
unite their efforts with ours in the attempt to
put an end to this British slavery, a thousand
times more debasing and severe than any which
the sons of Africa have at any time undergone.
Let the tables of the two Houses of Parliament
be overloaded with petitions from every city,
borough, parish, and hamlet in the three king-
doms, praying that the nation may be relieved
from this terrible crime of gradual but whole-
sale infanticide. And we trust that Senators
will be found in the new Parliament, in that
Parliament even from which so active and en-
lightened a philanthropist as Mr. Sadler is ex-
cluded, to follow in his footsteps as the advocate
of suffering humanity, and the bold and zealous
asserters of the rights and the dignity of human
nature.—Morning Post.

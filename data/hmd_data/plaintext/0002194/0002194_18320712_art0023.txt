NATIONAL PO ITICAL UNION.

The Council of this Union held their weekly
meeting last night, at the usual time and place, J.
Cartwright Thomas, Esq. in the Chair.

PLEDGES OF CANDIDATES FOR M. P.

After some introductory remarks relevant to the
rules of the Union,

Mr. F. PLACE said, that he had concocted (in
conformity with the request of several of his friends
and correspondents, and with the desire of the Com-
mittee of this Union) several observations on the
subject of pledges to be demanded from candidates
proposing to become representatives in the Reformed
House of Commons. Many persons and bodies
throughout the country seemed to be disunited, if
not distracted, on the demands most desirable and
appropriate, and had requested some specified ones
from the Council of this Union, as the leading po-
litical body in London; and he was aware that the
subject was of vital importance at the present
moment, and the sooner the better something defi-
nitive were done. He read a pamphlet, which he
considered should be printed and distributed by the
Council as extensively as possible, and thought that
those he alone could sell would pay half the expense,
for several candidates themselves had promised him
to have them distributed in their own districts, and
to purchase so many at a certain rate. The pamphlet
ably details the mode of representation and the cha-
racter of representatives formerly ; it points out the
duty of electors in a succinct and cogent manner,
and the best means of exercising their rights as con-
stituents. It then concludes with proposing, as
pledges to be exacted every where from candidates
at the ensuing election,

1. PARLIAMENTARY ThisREFORM.— pledge in-
cludes shortening the duration of Parliaments and
conceding the vote by ballot ; for were the whole
nation to be divided into electoral districts, and the
votes taken by ballot, Parliaments could not be too
short, nor the right of voting too extensive. At
present the duration of Parliaments should be limited
to three years.
2. LAW REFORM. This should include a
thorough revision of all laws common and statute,
civil and criminal, corporate and municipal. The
abolition of all arbitrary jurisdictions—the abridge-
ment as far as possible of all vexation and delay or
expense—the detection of crimes, and the certainty
of speedy punishment, should be included with the
abolition of all barbarous and cruel punishments, and
the adoption of such only as are commensurate with
the offence committed.
3. FINANCIAL REFORM.—This includes the re-
duction of all taxes possible, and of all overpaid
salaries and pensions, as well as payments of every
kind, from the highest office in the State to the
owest ; and the total abolition of all the sinecures,
and of all useless offices and unearned pensions. It
is advisable that indirect taxes (and those especially
which press most heavily on trade and manufac-
tures, on commerce and the comforts of the people)
should be repealed in preference to direct taxes.
Had there been none but direct taxes, the public
would never have submitted to be taxed to half the
amount at present exacted.
4. TRADE REFORM.—This includes the abolition
of all monopolies, particularly the monopoly of the
corn laws. The free admission of all sorts of pro-
duce for manufactures, and indeed of he, trade in
every respect, that the greater number may no
longer be compelled to purchase anything at an
advanced price to increase enormously the profits of
a few comparatively.
J. CHURCH REFORM.—This includes, 1. Equa-
lization, to a great extent, of the Church Establish-
ment. Every dignity of the Church preaches po-
verty, yet wallows in wealth; but great wealth
being condemned as incompatible with true religion,
therefore none of its ministers should be wealthy.
2. Ceasing to pay any person or party, by any one,
for the maintenance of any particular doctrine or
mode of worship, of which he does not approve.
And therefore, 3. The abolition of tithes, in the
fairest way and in the shortest time possible.
6. ABOLITION OF SLAVERY.—This includes the
freedom of every person of every caste, and colour,
and climate. Slavery, in itself, is unjust; and
though its abolition without compensation to the
slaveholder may appear unjust, it is a much greater
injustice to retain persons in slavery than to manu-
mit them without compensation. It becomes, then,
the duty of the Legislature to emancipate slaves
with the least injustice possible to the slaveholders.

7. TAXES ON KNOWLEDGE.—These taxes are the
stamp duty on newspapers, the excise duty on pa-
per, and the duty on advertisements. Thus the
pledges to be exacted should be of a nature general
as possible, while the details should be reciprocally
particular : so as to give Members really honestt!

Mr. HICKSON considered that every Member
should pledge himself to resign, if his constituents
tirid that he has not redeemed the pledges he may

have given when a candidate. He also thought that
the abolition of all corporate rights, inimical to mu-
nicipal freedom, and the abolition of tithes, should
be more strongly and strenuously enforced.
Mr. COOKE thought that none should be a voter
who was not able to read.
Mr. CIIEESEMAN warmly opposed such a tenet.
Mr. PLACE, in reply, considered that every elector
should not only be able to read, but actually to
write, as his knowledge of reading and writing
would spread information and prove of public utility,
as well as tend to prevent private bribery. Con-
cerning a member resigning, that should never be
made a pledge by any constituency. If the majo-
rity of electors in any place should consider their
representative unfaithful, a general meeting may be
held to arraign him for the supposed failure; but it
would be preposterous and impracticable to exact a
pledge of resigning from any candidate according to
the discretion of a few. He ably elucidated the
different topics in the pledges, and moved that
10,000 copies of the pamphlet be printed:—
Agreed to.
Mr. PLACE then moved that a similar number of
a tract on the Ballot be Printed.—Agreed to.
IRISH TITHES.—Mr. CHURCHILL moved resolu-
tions on the subject of tithes in Ireland—that it is
unjust to tax any person or party for the maintenance
of t hose propagating opinions or supporting a system
of religion believed by those taxed to be false; that
the people of Ireland deserve the gratitude of the
nation at large, for the determined and peaceable op-
position made by them to the oppressive exactions
of tithes in that country; and that any enactment
which may be made, granting legislative security in
the levying of tithes in any form, should be opposed
by every legal means by the people of Ireland, who
should be assisted in their resistance by the deter-
minate opinion of the British nation.

On the motion of Mr. CHURCHILL, seconded by
Mr. OWEN, it was resolved that a petition should
be prepared on these resolutions.
A committee was then appointed to consider the
best means of celebrating the passing of the Reform
Bilis.
The council subsequently adjourned.

COURT OF EXCHEQUER, JULY 11.

KINNERSLEY AND ANOTHER V. SOMERS.

The plaintiffs are woollen-drapers, carrying on bu-
siness in Marylebone-street. The defendant is a
gentleman of fortune residing in Ireland.
This was an action for two bills of exchange—one
for 5601., drawn by the defendant on a Mr. M`Do-
riough, by whom it was accepted on the 21st of
April, 1830, and payable two years after date ; the
other for 6001. drawn and accepted by the same par-
ties in June 1831, and paysble ten months after date
i:oth having been endorsed to the plaintiffs by Wm.
Cowper, a tailor, residing in Sackville-street, Pic-
cadilly.
Mr. EARL, for the defendant, stated that the hills
in question had been given to Cowper by the
ac-
ceptor, M'Donough, then a minor, for a usurious
consideration, and that the plaintiffs had taken them,
knowing that the' were tainted with usury.
Augustus 111'llonough—I have got a release from
the defendant for all claims on account of these bills.
I became of age on the 31st of March last. I was
introduced to Cowper as a customer, by the de-
fendant, in the summer of 1829, and lodged in Cow-
per's house in the autumn of 1830. I told him I
warted a loan of money. He said he had none to
lend, but would endeavour to procure me some, but
he did not think he could do so without paying high
interest. I told him I would give any money for
a loan, as I wanted it very much. I saw him again
a short time afterwards, when he said that it would
be necessary to get the defendant to sign a bill. I
said I wanted 3001. He said he did not think he
could get that sum for less than a bill of 5601. I
accordingly got the defendant to draw a bill
to that amount on me, which was made payable
in two years, as I should be then of age. I gave
it to Cowper, and received from him 3001. in dif-
ferent payments. In the October following I gave
him a bill, which was also drawn by the defendant,
for 1,000/ for a loan of 5001.; and in April, 1831,
I gave him a similar bill (one of those now in ques-
tion) for 6001., in consideration of receiving from
him 3001. He gave me in all 1,1001, for which I
gave him bills to the amount of 2,1601.
George Cowper, brother of 'William Cowper,
heard the latter say that he received the bills in
question for a usurious consideration.
The Jury having deliberated a short time, re-
turned a verdict for the defendant, on the grounds
that they believed the plaintiffs to be aware of the
usury when they took the bills from Cowper.

MARKET INTELLIGENCE.

LONDON MARKETS.

(From the London New Price Current of yesterday.)
The West India interests are thrown into a state of the greatest
agitation. The Jamaica Papers received yesterday give an ex-
tract of a despatch from the Colonial Secretary, Lord Goderich,
to the Governor of Jamaica, stating that Ministers have no
measure to propose respecting slavery, except the following up
of the resolutions of 1823, respecting the amehoration of the state
of the slaves. This, we suspect, is far from being the case; we
understand that Orders in Council have already been transmitted
to the Crown Colonies—ordering rations, similar to the soldiery
—two suits of raiment per annum—two pairs of shoes—regula-
tions as to the quantity of flour and diet; and as many of these
regulations are contrary to the terms of capitulation when the
colonies were given up to England, the measures are refused, and
an answer has been returned that they cannot be complied with.
There is also another Order of Council about to be issued for the
British Colonies, allowing the negrces to purchase their freedom,
if not altogether, for one day in the week, for two days, and so
on, till their emancipation is completed, and similar regulations,
as to food and clothing, as in the Crown Colonies.—The Sugar
Refinery Bill is to be brought forward to-morrow.
SUGAR.—The estimated sales of Muscovades last week were
3,000 hhds. and trs. ; the Market has a firmer appearance. The
stock of West India Sugar is now 55,267 hhds. and trs., which is
1,048 less than last year. The stock of Mauritius 124,851 bags,
being 87,254 more than last year. The delivery of West India
Sugar last week 3,530 hhds. and trs., being 281 more than last
year. The delivery of Mauritius 6,764 bags, being 2,458 more
than in the corresponding week of 1830. Al the conclusion of
this day's Market the estimated sales were 800 hhds. and trs. at
full prices. The destruction of the Island of Barbadoes by a
hurricane, 11th ult. had no effect on the Sugar Market. Towards
the close of last week the demand for Refined goods increased
very considerably, and the prices advanced 6d. to Is. per cwt.;
low Lumps 61s. 6d. and 625., and the market was nearly cleared
at the improvement ; the sales of fine goods were also extensive,
but generally at lower prices. The Refined Market is quiet this
afternoon, on account of the few good, left on the Market, about
400 hhds. lately sold. :The Market is firm.
EAST INDIA SUGARS.—The Mauritius Sugars sold last
week rather heavily, but withk•ut any marked difference in the
prices. Bengals sold a shade lower; Manilla at former rates.
This day 6,515 bags Mauritius sold at full Market prices, 325. 6d.
a 50s. 6d., a few of the brown taken in ; 4,177 bags Manilla sold
at a small advance, 19s. 6d. a '22s. 6d.

FOREIGN SUGARS.-The white Brazil Sugars are held with
great firmness, in the expectation that the Foreign Sugar Re-
finery Bill will pass into a law. The sales of yellow Havannah
have been considerable, 255. being an advance of Is. to Is. 6d. ;
the white neglected. Low Brazil Sugars have sold in parcels at
higher prices, 15s. 6d. a 18s. Average price of Sugar 11. 2s. '7d.
per cwt.
COFFEE.-At the public sales last week the low descriptions
of British Plantation Coffee again advanced 2s. ; good ord. Ja-
maica 68s. a 695., fine ord. 725. a 735., and low mid. 745. a 765.
The other purchases consisted of large parcels of Brazil 465. 6d.
a 475., St. Domingo 475., Sumatra 395. a 405., Batavia 425. a 475.
Mocha Coffee fell 2s. a3s , considerable sales 645. a 658. This
day 168 casks 23 brls. British Plantation sold again 2s. higher,
broken Jamaica 695., good ord. 71s a 735. ; of 30 casks 1,026 bags
Cuba only a small part sold, fine ord. to mid. 68s. to 755.
RUM, BRANDY, and HOLLANGS.-The Rum market
continues dull, notwithstanding the large quantity lately taken
for shipping; a parcel under proof Is. 4 d., but there are buyers
at that price, and no sellers under Is. sd. ; some low parcels of
Jamaica have been taken for export at low prices.-Brandy is
more firm, and the purchases considerable.-In Geneva there is
no alteration.
HEMP, FLAX, and TALLOW.-The Tallow market is very
firm, and-from the late purchases we may expect large deliveries
for home consumption; the quantity delivered from the ware-
houses last week was nearly 5,000 casks.-Hemp is very dull, and
may again be purchased lower.-Flax at nearly nominal quotations.
OILS.-Oils continue to be held with firmness, and are ad-
vancing on account of the absence of all reports of the Davis'
Straits Fishery ; the rise is 1/. to 2/.
FRUIT.-There are arrivals of new Fruit, but no actual sales.
About 260 pack Currants sold last week, butts 665. a 695., care-
teels 68s. a 70s.
SALTPETRE.-The prices are higher, rough sold 395. a
38s. 6d., East India Company's Refined 41s. buyers.
RICE.-In Rice there is no alteration.
SPICES.-Pimento and Pepper are in demand at prices a shade
higher ; Pepper unsifted sold in parcels, ::78d. a 3;id., no sellers
now at 2y,d. Good Pimento 5%c1.
INDIGO.-The declarations for the next sale are now nearly
9,000 chests, and snore are expected ; the Market here is very
heavy, on account of the sales at Liverpoolbeing3d. per lb. lower.
TEA.-The delivery of all descriptions since the sale has been
immense. Bolleas are now at 3s. 91„i: d. duty paid, being an ad-
vance on sale's prices of 3d. per lb. on those which cost Is. 9,4 d.

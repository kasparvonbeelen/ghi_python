Government had violated their pledges,
therefore, vote for the amendment of the Wm
for Wexford.

Lord ALTHORP said that if his Hon. F'
to hear his concurrence in what had been at
Hon. Member—namely, that Government
punish any infringement of the Bill by
powers to the collection of tithe, he (Lord
perfectly ready to express such concurrence,
to be the duty of Government to punish such
by dismissal or otherwise.

Mr. A. LEFROY vindicated the Marquis
meath from the aspersions cast on him with
tithe.

The House then divided on the amendment,
appeared—

The amendment being, consequently, lost.
Lord ALTHORP said that, according to
would now proceed shortly to state the objects .
to effect. By the Act passed for the composition
in Ireland, after the year 1833, it had been
after this period, the occupying tenants should be
liable to the payment of tithes. It was,
thought most desirable, under the circumstance'
bad occurred, and which bad been alluded to:
in the course of that evening's debate, that
should take measures for relieving those tenants
present time. It was not in his power, at that
state exactly the amount of the sum which it
necessary for Parliament to advance for this pt.
he thought it was incumbent upon the Houser
occasion, to pledge themselves generally to
certain sum of money for these purposes. If ti
to such a resolution as this, the clergy of Irelat
be under no necessity of having recourse to all
harsh measures to insure their support. The tol
which this money ought to be advanced would
land tax, payable in Ireland in a limited number
out of all land liable to tithe; but those who I
their tithes for the years 1831 and 1832 she'll
empted from this tax, the receipts for such parser
held a sufficient proof. The Noble Lord cot
moving--" That it was the opinion of that Hot
certain sum of money shonlo eed by P'
to the established clergy in Ireland, 1.. under to et
to relieve the occupying tenantry from the pl
tithe, the money to be payable by a land tax,"
Colonel PERCEVAL wished to know whether
to extend to lay impropriators ?
Lord ALTHORP said the clergy were the only
contemplated.

Sir R. PEEL wished to know whether they i►.-
quittance for all arrears, including those before tir
1831. It was necessary that there should be a
understanding on this point.

Lerd ALTHORP explained that, in his opinion,
clergy got the sum he proposed to give them, they
be satisfied. It was to be recollected, none of these
went back to 1831, and the clergy, he believed,
ready to give a receipt in full for all their demands
received the sum he proposed. With respect to
question, it must be evident to the House that this
only a temporary measure, which would not 131
means interfere with any existing laws. It eir
cessary that the resolution should be carried as
possible, and be thought they ought to come to a
at once.

Mr. SHAW said the clergy would receive the
tion of the Noble Lord with fairness and candour.

The CHAIRMAN was then ordered to report
and ask leave to sit again.
The House resumed.—The Committee to sit &OD

The report of the Committee of the whole 06

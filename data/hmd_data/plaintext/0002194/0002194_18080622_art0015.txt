Belle Poule, Capt. BtfisEANg, and Plato, Captain
JANVERIN, ha‘re put into our roads by contrary
WindS; they formed a knost •pleasibg sight to the.
town, and much gratification to our fashionable visi-
tants,

Yesterday -being a charming day, numerous water
parties were formed, and the Bay covered wii b plea-
sure boats sailing round the fleet ; the %Omit: day
was a scene or bustle and gaiety by the coining on
shore of multiplicity of Passengers and. Otti-::ers of
the army, on their passage to join their respecliTe

• The great number of boats tliiit are row nto
-
and trout the town, give it the appearance of a be-
siegeci garrison, and it being market day, the produc,
tious of our excellent market was put in a state cif
immediate- requisition, and sent on board the differ-
ent ships.

The balance account of arrivals and departdres
in the course of the present mouth, is greatly in
favour at the former, as will appear in course; and
the rumour of a camp to be fanned near this toivu
the latter end of July, is still afloat.

Among the niany improvements of this place
may be justly noticed its ample snpply di good water
conveyed hither in pipes from the Spring Head, a
distance of near .five miles : our situation in the
Channel ,is such, that Government, a few years age;
sent their Surveyor to Portland and round this wait,
to discover. where.his Majesty's Ships of War may
coliveniendy water, but did not succeed.

This valuable acquisition is now completely •ac?
complished; a great number, cif ships yesterday
made up their deficiency of water for their voyage ;
the casks were filled in the boats in the harl)9,lr,
laying alongside the qufty;by a communication

of the. concern, with Rich judgment, as to cause five
large casks to be filled in, the course .4* ten minutes,
affording the greatest facility in acco,ntno:fating hia

exactly similar to 1116 present, 'and Lord Hardwicke

About the age of 'twenty...three he entered ititd•the

evening, on a summer's day, seetniii/ eider great

Made. in America, from a presumptinu that he Might
be kidnapped to that Continent,, or talc- \Vest Indies,
but all in Vain. Days, months, and ;Teats, then
passed on, but. no. account could be obtained,—

Cathal, however, was not dead, but he jiad con-

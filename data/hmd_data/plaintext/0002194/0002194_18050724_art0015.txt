.THE OPPOSITION DRITITR.

IN ADDISON'S Whig Examiner, No. 111, there is a very
curious and a very clOse analogy between the Party Ran-
cour of • the Times in •which that celebrated Author lived
and these which are now passing under our own eyes.—
. some-few alterations, which must be obvious to the
Reader, the •Extrad which follows will become se appli_
. cable, that one would. at first imagine it had been in some,
degree written with a spirit of prophecy to the implacable
antipathies of the present Day. Let it also be rement<
bend, that the Brewer whom we are .now about to diatin-
..guish by the Subsequent Qolumn, had been at one time
violent Patriot, and a loud., Declaimer against the'conand
of the Government of his Country. W iththe alterations
alluded to, the. following Address may be thought to bear
a striking analogy with modern -events... But let the Whig
lixaMiner speak for himself in these Words :

4 ALCIBIADES was a man of-wit and . pleasure,
bred up in the school of soerates, and one of the
best Orators of his age, notwithstanding helived at
a time when learning was at. its highest pitch : he
was likewise very famous for'his military exploits,
having gained great conquests over the LaCdetuo-
- • who had formerly been the confederates of
his countrymen against the great:King of Persia, but
were at that time in allir.bee with the Persians. He
had been once so far misrepresented and traduced
by the malice of his 'enemies, that the Priests cursed
him. But after the great services which he had done
for his. Country, they publicly repealed their curse,
and changed them into applauses and benedic-
tions., _ - • 1• '

Phitarch tells.us, in the life' of Alcibiades, that
one Tanreus, an. obscure man, contended with him
fora certain prize, which was to be conferred by
vote ; at which tiim each of the conipetittirs re-
comniended himself to the Athenian's by an oration.
The speech Which Alcibiades made on that occa-
sion has been latterly discovered among the manu-
scripts of King's College, in-Cambridge,; and com-
municated to me by my learned Friend, Dr. B--;-ley
who tells me, that by a marginal note it appears,
that thii Taureus, Or, as theiDo&or. rather chuses
'to call him, Toryas, was an Athenian Brewer. This
speech I have translated literally, changing 'very little
in it, except where it Was absOlutely .necesSary. to
make it understood by an English Reader. It is.as
follows,: •

" Is it then possible,.o ye Athenians, that I:who
hitherto have had none but Generals to oppose me,.
must nosy have an artizan' for my. antagonist ; that
I'who have overthrown the Princes.of Lacedreinon
must now..see myself in danger of being defeated by
a Brewer P. What Will :the. world say of the Gotk!.
dess that. presides over you, shOold they suppose
you follow her didates ? virovoii, they think she
afted like herself—like thereat Minerva ? . Would
' they say, :she inspires hersons with wisdom ? or
would they not • rather say, she has a sectind time
chosen owls for her favourites :? 0 ye men. of
Athens ! what has this man done to deserve your
voices ? You say he is .honesti I believe it, and'
therefore he shall rew for me. You
.say he is 'assi-
duous in ,his calling : and is :he not grown rich by
it ? Let him have your custom--but net your
votes you are, now to cast your eyes on guise who
can detect the artifices of the conamon .enemy, that
can disappoint your secret foes in Council, 'and your
open ones in the field. Let it• not avail my corn-
' petitor that he has been tapping,' his .liquors While
I have, been spilling my blood.; ,;that lie has been .
gathering hops for you while I have 'been rearing
laurels. Have I not borne the dust and heat of the
;
' day v. bilehe has been sweating at the furnace ? Be-
hold these sears---behold thiS wound which still
bleeds in your service ; what can Taureu.s.shew you
Of this nature ? What are his marks of honour
Has he any other wound about him except the acci-
dental scaldings of his Wort, ..or bruises from the tub
or barrel ? Lei it not, 0 Athenians ! let it not be
said that your; Generals' have conquered themselves
into your displeaaure, and lost your favour by gaining
you victories. Shall those,achievements that have
redeemed the present age from slavery be under-
valued by those who feel the benefits of them ?
Shall, those names that have made your city the glory
of the whole Earth be mentioned in it with obloquy
and detraCtion ? Will not yOur posterity blush at'
• their forefathers,, when they shall read in the annals
of their Country, that AlCibiades, in the Both Olym7
'OA, after having. conquered the Lacaademonians, ;
and recovered Byzantium, contended for a
„prize
against Taureus the Brewer P The competition is
dishonourable ; the defeat would be shameful. I
shall not, however, slacken my endeav6urs for the
security of my country.. .If she is ungrateful; she.
is still Athens: On the contrary, as "she will stand
more in ,need of defence when she has so degenerate
a people, I .will pursue my yiCharies till such time, as
it shall be out of your power to hurt yourselves, and
that you may be, in safety even underyour present
hiders. But oh ! thou Genius of Athens whither
art thou fled ! Where is now the race Of those glo-
rious spirits that perished at the battle of Thermo-
pylw, and foughtupon the, plains of. Marathon ? Are
you weary of conquering, or have you forgotten the
oath which you took at Agraulos—That you would
leoklipon tine bounds of Attica, to be those Soils

Lacaidetruniiaria ; did you :ever hear that they ,pte-.!
ferred a Coffee-man to Agesilans ) No, though their
Generals have been unforttinate, though they have
lost several 'battles, though' they have not been able
to cope with the troops of Athens, whiCh I have
conduCtecl, they are comforted and condoled ;. nay
celebrated and extolled, by, their fellow-cithena:
Their Generals have been received with honour af-
ter their defeats—yours 'with ignominy after 'con-
quest: Are there not men of Taureus's temper and,-
character, who tremble -in their hearts at the name
of the great King of Persia ? who:have been against
'entering into a.! War with him; or for making a Peace

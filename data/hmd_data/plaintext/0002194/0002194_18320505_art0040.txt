Trinidad Papers state that the West India Colonies are
in a very unsettled state, and that there is a very strong
opposition on the subject of slavery from the white inha-
bitants of the island.

Papers to the 23(1 January, have been received at the
North and South American Coffee-house.

with one continued hurricane, and the late crops have al-
ready felt the influence of the rains.

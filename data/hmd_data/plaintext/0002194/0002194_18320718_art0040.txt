IV. TRADE REFORM.

This includes the abolition of all monopolies, and more
especially the Co,n Law monopoly ; the free admission of
all sorts of produce for manufacturers, and indeed of free
trade in every respect, that the greater number may nu
longer be compelled to purchase anything at an advanced
price that the profits of a very small comparative number
may be unduly increased.
V. CHURCH REFORM.

This includes-
1. Equalization to a great extent of the Church E,ta.
blishment. Every dignitary of the Church preaches po-
verty and wallows in wealth. Great wealth being con-
demned as incompatible with the true religion, none of its
ministers should therefore be wealthy.
2. Ceasing to compel any one to pay for the main-
tenance of any particular doctrine he does not approve.
3. Abolition of tithes in the fairest way and in the
shortest time possible.
VI. ABOLITION OF SLAVERY.

This includes the freedom of every person, of every
colour, and every shade of colour; holding of persons in
slavery is unjust, atrocious, and cruel ; abolition of slaver:,
without compensation to slave holders is also unjust,
it is intvitable, and therefore less unjust than retaining
them as slaves. It becomes then the duty of the Legiel:-

cure to emancipate all slaves, with the least injustice, as
well to the slave holders as to slaves themselves, and inâ€¢as
little time as possible, compatible with the smallest amount
of evil.

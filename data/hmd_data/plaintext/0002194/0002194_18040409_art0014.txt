In an American Paper the following article is
given under date, Salem, February to.—" While
Captain SAUN DE as, who arrived at this Port yester-
day, was at Surinam, the Dutch Commodore, BLo TS
VAN TR ESLONG, sent a party of men on board his
vessel, who took from him one man and. two ap-
prentices, whom the Commodore refused to restore.;
giving no other reason for keeping them, than he
wanted men. The conduct of the Commodore had
rendered him universally obnoxious. Of 117 men
on.noard the Frigate, ninety-seven were said to be
pressed from on board American vessels, who of
course were much disafft to d. The British Schooner
IVetley, with 'l7O volunteers, was off the place,
.with the design of cutting her out--a desperate en-
terprize—as she would have a strong Fortress, cal-
led Fort Braam, and the Frigate was under the
heavk guns of Fort Amsterdam, where the Dutch,
aware of the Design of the British, had stripped
:her of her sails, &c. to render it the more difficult
of execution."

A Bill fur the gradual abolition of Slavery has
passed the Legislature of Pennsylvania, which is
now engaged in a proposition for altering the Con-
stitution of the.-United States. In the S.*ace of New
Jersey a Bill has been passed, declaring .-)at all per-
sons of colour born in slavery, after the Ist of July
next, shall he free ; the males on attaining the age
of 25, and the females it years.

The-following Eleaoral Ordunrance is published-

1 Highness immediately
"His most Serene Eltiaora
after the re.establislunent of Peace.ber ween the Ger_

Ordvnnance, for his ancient possession; declaring in
the most precise and positive terms,. that ro farther
residence in his territory would be ,granted, to any
persons who had emigrated, or.. been deported- from
the ,French Republic. The war which-.afterwards
ensued, having ..occasitined :these persons•.again..to,re-
ttirn into the country,. his Serene EleCtoral Highness.
availed himself of the first favourable moment; to ar
tier their removal tilde( the date of, the 20.. h of June,
1799. The renewal of peace again brought back into
the. country,. those who had ;served...ln the 'army
of CoNDE ; and his Serene Eleaoral Highness saw
himself obliged to issue a new Ordonnauce, which
still subsists ; according to which, no- Frenchman,

bury, and .Catherine Fitzgerald, a woman of in-
, famous charaaer, were tried for assaulting a lady
'and tier daughter on the gallery staircase of Co-
vent-Garden Theatre. The condutt of the man
• was the !MST brutal that can possibly be conceived,
'he. having adually turned the lady's cloaths upon
her shoulders, and committed other personal lode-
. cencies of the most atrocious kind, while the woman
stood by, swearing, encouraging, and assisting him
in the violence. They were both found Guilty,
and sentenced to three months'. imprisonment in the
• House of CorreCtion. The prosecution vas carried
on by the Proprietors of the Theatre, who deserve
the thanks of the Public for the laudable -and spi-
rited manner in which they came forward.

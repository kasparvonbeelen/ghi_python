",The advocates for the system of Working in
the Spinning Factories from 14 to 15 hours A day,
allowing hut one interval of rest in the course of
it, oancely, an hour at most at dinner, and in
some instances only 40 minutes, strenuously con-
tend, that it hios a favourable tendency in secor7

are thus employed. Rut !Pt try eltdeaVOlir to look
into the Hemel circtonstances of the ease, and irc
the Outset state the following received propo
sitious
1.. Ist, That h has been the custom et many,
if not all of the Factories in Mituchester and its
immediate neighboarhood, to employ Children at
the 'early egos of 6 nod 7, and in (.-..orne even under
That these Children have certainly no
time in the week-days fOr mental instruction.-
3d, That it clearly appears, from it recent int-
partinl investigation, Only a small portion of them
attend Sunday Schools, which, considering how
much they are confined in the %Yea. days, is not:
extraordinary.--4th.,, That therefore the great
majority Of 'theta as they grow up Must be 'goo'.

belie Stated are correct, and we may sett:ly confide
them to our positive local knowledge 111)(1 the evi-
dence of our senses, den how is it possiHe for
the system of eniploymcnt just mentioned to fa-
vour morals and good order ?
" As to the lamentable con,equencei which in
other respects result from the troial mode of em-
ploying Children in these Factories, they may be
referred chiefly to the following canes,

going on, as the Children of other Factories in
general get their breakfest and afternoon refresh.

work fifteen hours a clay, incholiagthe time
allowed for dinner, have et/content:et, their labial Ors

" Lest,dlowever, the instances of protracted 1;1.
boor here spoken of should lead to Unfair in-
ferences as to the prevailing custom 'of workiog
the Factdries io Manchester and its immediate
,neighboarliond, We should • observe that by fear
the most general practice is fourteen hours a day,
allowing. one boor for dinner ; and that it is the
Arita five days only id the week or which we are
speaking, for on Saturdays it, is the geneealCus-
ttou to give over work at four o'clock. Never-
theless at tine Factory, which until about Mid-
jtintitter butt was generally - accustomed to work
fifteen boors hem day, and which allows ooly
•torty minutes for dinner, it is the uniform prac-
tice to work on this last day of the week till six

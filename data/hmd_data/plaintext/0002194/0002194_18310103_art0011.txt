ST. PETERSBURGII PAPERS.

Sr. PITERSBUGII, DEC. 15.—The Journals of this
city contain the following news :
" Since the reports, dated the 2d instant, sent to his
Majesty the Emperor by hie Imperial Highness the
Cesarewitsch, the contents of which were published on
the 11th, his Majesty has received no further commtthica-
tion directly from his Imperial Highness. Accounts,
however, have been received from different quarters, that
the spirit of insurrection spreads more and more in the
kingdom of Poland, and that in consequence of this the
Cesarewitsch, with the Russian troops under his com-
mand, had been obliged to make a movement towards the
frontiers of Volhynia.
" A private letter in '..s ice gaYsii ti., fol-
lowing particulars of th., Address c ..- Emperor on the
Bth, to the assembled officers. After his Majesty hse,
communicated the even's in Wersaw, adding that seders
to march had already be:. sent to Lithainiau r•.irpe,
the Ist corps of infantry, with tiree divisions of tine gre-
nadier corps, and the 3d- corps of reserve of the cavalry,
his Majesty, looking at the officers who stood round him,
added, I hope, if it she uld be necessary for me to march
out with the Guards, they will prove on this, as on all
other occasions, their attachment and devotedness.' When
the aeclaniatiens with which the faithful warriors re-
ceived this snack of his Majesty's conidence had a little
subsided, the Emperor, swabs, zunotion viziLle in
Lis countenance,: pronounced these remarkable words :
I beg you, Gentlemen, not to be hostile to the Poles,
they are our brethren. The blame of the insurrection
lies with a few ill-disposed persons. I hope, with God's
assistance, that all will end for the best."'

On the 10th his Majesty addressed the following Ukase
to the directing Senate :
" Considering the present state of affairs in the kingdom
of Poland, I judge it to be necessary to unite the civil and
military Government in the adjoining provinces of Volhynia
and Podolia, and have therefore been pleased to appoint my
Adjutant-General Potemkin, to be pro tempore military
Governor of those Provinces, exercising at the seine time
the Civil Government with all the privileges and duties
attached to it. (Signed) " NICHOLAS."
_ .

It is known, by the accounts received, that Count Za-
ruoyski, President of the Polish Senate, has been obliged,
in consequence of the disorders at Warsaw, to take refuge
in Brzese Litewski.

On the 9th instant, Rhea the drama " Juryi Milos-
towski" (or the Russians in. 1612) was performed in the
great theatre, loud acclamations burst from the audience
at the words of Juryi, "Hail to Russia's lawful Sovereign !
Destruction to all traitors to their country !"

The buzzaing was repeated still mere loudly after the
actor, at the desire of the public, had repeated the passage
with much emphasis and feeling.

Field-Marshal Count DiebitsCh SAbalkanski arrived here
from Berlin the night before last.
The Adjutant-General Chrapowitzki set out for Wilna on
the 9th. The Adjutant-General Chrapowitzki is gone to
Scitomir, and Adjutant-General Kleinmichel to the mili-
tary colonies of the grenadier corps.
On the morning of 7th November, there were still 354
persons sick of the cholera at Moscow, of whom 205 were
expected to recover.

BRUSSELS PAPERS.

BRUSSELS, DEC. 29.—M. Sylvan Van de Weyer, and
Count Vilain XIII. set out this morning at six o'clock on
a mission to London. They are appointed Commis.
sioners to the Congress at London. Messrs. Wallez and
Desire will go to London as Secretaries of Legation.
M. Charles Lehon is appointed Minister of the Diplo-
matic Committee.

A British Cabinet messenger arrived here last night
with despatches from London. Another British Cabinet
messenger left this city last night with despatches for Paris.
The King of Holland has just permitted all the Belgian
ships detained at Flushing to depart, restoring their
P9erg. The Prince of Orange, for Rio, and the Catha-
Tina for London, sailed immediately.
On Sunday last the Dutch made another sally from
Alsestricht. After four or five hours' skirmishing, they
retreated. We had one man killed, and three wounded.
The Dutch seem to have lost six or seven men, besides
prisoners.

Psc. 30.—We hear that M. Charles Brouckere is ap-
pointed Administrator-General of the Finances, M. Coghvn,
it Is said, retires from public affairs.
,„ is said that the Duke of Saxe Weimar, or General
an Geen, is gone with 8.000 men towards Macstricht.
This report was generally here on the 28th. To-day
has we kear, that General Daine, with 5,000 men,
"as marched to Campine, which seems threatened with a
11econd invasion. We cannot wholly credit this news ; for,
hitherto, we believe the Military Authorities of the arty
have received no official information.—Politique.

NATIONAL CONGRESS, DEC. 28.
In this sitting the Assembly discussed several articles
of the Budget (the Estimate of the Revenue for 1831 is
36,626,727 f. 57c.)
DEC. 29.--M. de Robaulx made the following pro-
P°l°l:--The Diplomatic Committee shall be invited to
give to the Congress information on the following points :
" 1. The state of our diplomatic relations, and on what
basis they are opened with the Envoys of the five great
Powers at London.

" 2. If the choice of the future head of the State is, or
has been, a subject of their negociations
"3• If, in case Holland perseveres in not executing
the conditions of the suspension of arms, measures have
been taken and orders given to resume hostilities within a
stated time ?

"4. If the Committee has opened, or is going to open
negociations with France for a treaty of commerce, which
may facilitate the reciprocal interchange of the productions
"f the two countries ?"
M. Robaulx said, that general anxiety respecting our
affairs prevailed : it is indispensable formally to contradict
the reports from which it would seem that the Powers in-
tend to choose a Chief for us, instead of leaving the choice
to the nation.
The President thought the motion concerned partly the
Department for Foreign Affairs—partly the War Depart-
ment.
Robattlx-1';.,, Sir ; I apply only to the Diplomatic
Committee, because it can furnish the information 1 ask.
Count de Celles--If the Congress desires a written an-
swer, the Diplomatic Committee will doubtless give it
When the proposition is referred to it; but meantime, if
the Congress persists, I will observe on some of the points
on which the explanation is asked.
On all sides—" Yes, yes ; but without prejudice to the
answer of the Committee."
M. de Celles—l can only repeat in some manner what
14, Van de Weyer has already communicated. I will add,
bswever, that the Diplomatic Committee will never act
out of its proper sphere, or go beyond its powers; and
therefiere that it could not negociate on the choice of a
Sovereign, which belongs exclusively to the Belgian
tition. It is known that hostilities have been interrupted
by an armistice, signed by us and our enemies. It has
been our duty to observe it, but it has been confounded
,vith the question of the naviotion of the Scheldt. All
at has taken place on this subject is independent of the
iplomatic Committee, and of the will of the five Powers,
hich will probably find means to force the enemy to ob-
Tye the conventions.

Our independence is recognised, though the formal
'let of Recognition is not published ; but if it were, we are
-no young, as an independent State, to negociate Treaties
,)1 Commerce. This is what I can say in answer to 111.
Robaulx. If the Congress desires more, the Diplomatic
Committee will answer.
M. Robaulx—l have just heat d that the Powers force
the free navigation of the Rhine to be respected. This is
any thing but a pacific intervention. If our enemies are
forced, we may be forced in our turn. The Diplomatic
Committee has no right to admit such principles. I for-
mally protest against such an excess of power ; we have
always been assured that the intervention would be wholly
Pacific and amicable. If Holland will not perform the
conventions to which it has agreed, we can answer by war.
The assembly resolved that the proposal of M. Robaulx
should be sent to the Provisional Government, with an in-
vitation to reply to it.
The remainder of this sitting, and that of the 30th,
were employed in discussing the project of law relative to
the Chamber of Accounts.
ANTWERP, Dec. 29.—News have been received that
that fine ship, the Antigone, built here, and belonging to
Outshorn, has run aground on the Isle of Walcheren,
going
to Aliddleburg. It came from Batavia with a cargo
r the Commercial Society of the Netherlands, and was
)ound to Antwerp, but late events forced it to alter its
lestination. It would be an immense loss to our city, and
144 as is suspected, it is due to a Dulch pilot caring but
for a Belgian ship, it is another circumstance to be
tided to our debt of gratitude to Nolland.—Brussels
',"Opere, Jan. 1.

asps, tremendous fall of snow, to the depth of
gra- ,urteen inches, took place on Wednesday afternoon, in
miry, e neighbourhood of Gloucester, and for some miles round
him, at city, which retarded the northern coaches to that
lard.; gree, that those which usually reach this city about half-
a al: .st seven in the evening, did not arrive till between one
nen Id two in the morning.—Bath Herald.

HINT TO LEGISLATORS.---There are is i 1 Al punishments against thieves ; but it
were much better

it put in a method how to live, and so be preserved from

04,11 .r. More.
It is not many months since the repeal of the
Aloe Union was first agitated, and to our eyes it then seemed
to promise very unfavourably. It was opposed almost
;dom universally by the men of
property, including those who 1 and Were most decidedly liberal ;it was discountenanced
tynia (with a very few exceptions) by the Catholic Clergy, the
it my guides and oracles of the people ; and it was advocated only
litary by a portion of the press, while the Dub/in Evening
time Post, which had long been, in a great measure, the organ
lutiee of the Catholics, with the Northern Whig, and other
talented papers, were against it, In spite of all these
Za- disadvantages, it has been making progress silently and
iged, rapidly ; and from the consequence it is daily acquiring,
efuge it seems very certain that the suffrages of all Ireland (a
iew Noblemen anel great Proprietors excepted) will soon
e united in its favour. When this happens, the Go-
re-nu:eat will have but two alternatives—to yield to the
Itiyersal voice of the people, or to stem the torrent by
istong measures, which, considering the spirit that is
aboad, and the effect of the lesson afforded by the ex.
Ate of the Parisians on men's minds, may involve the
sentry in civil war.—Scotsman.
ORIGIN OF THROWING AT COCKS ON
SkOVE TUESDAY.-An old German writer, of the name
°t-:.II.ANENSTEIN, we are informed, gives the following
calla of the origin of our throwing at cocks on Shrove
Tedai. Whilst the Danes were masters of England,
lorded it over the natives, the inhabitants of a certain
grown weary of slavery, had formed a secret conspi-
ty to murder their toasters in one bloody night, when
'else men had undertaken to enter the town-hill by stra-
gem, and seizing the arms, to surprise the guard which
kept it, at which time their fellows, upon a signal given,
'ere to come out of their houses, and murder all
,Pliosers : but they were putting this plan in
execution, the unusual crowing and fluttering of the
cock", near the place which they attsmpted to enter,
discovered and frustrated their design; upon which the
Panes became so enraged, that they redoubled their
bell'', exercising still greater severity over the English,
4)11 after, however, the English being freed from the
ini3li yoke, they instituted the custom of throwing at
atti eks on Shrove Tuesday, the day of their disappointment,
a stupid and barbarian passion of revenge against the
ntent cause of their misfortune, instead of admiring the
.
vigilance of the birds, however unfortunately ap-
led in a particular case : a reverse of the conduct of the
Mullis, who honoured the vigilance of geese which saved
e Capital. Thi, infamous sport, although at first only
actised its one city, in process of time became a national
tettion, and remains even to this hour, in some parts
eethe country, exhibiting a str,mg taint of original igno-
ce and barbarism in the national character, which has
been even yet wiped out by legislation.—Mowbray's
'tidal Treatise un Domestic Poultry.

LONDON,
MONDAY EVENING, JANUARY 3, 1831.

The Paris Papers of Friday and Saturday are
chiefly filled with particulars respecting the Law
of Elections. The concessions made to the
popular party by this law, will not, we are con-
vinced, satisfy them ; they expect, and will insist
on the adoption of an infinitely more liberal sys-
tem. The number of electors is double that in-
scribed on the old list, but even this, considering
the census of France, is far too limite4. In the
Chamber of Deputies, M. LAFITTE has hinted
in a very significant manner, that the principles
of the French Cabinet are pacific. "We have
the means," he said, " of making war, if France
were under the necessity of going to war ; we
should conduct the war in a victorious manner,
I doubt not, but our first duty is to preserve

peace."

Hamburg Papers contain but little fresh intel-
ligence of moment from Poland. The inhabitants
are, it seems, making the most strenuous exertions
to preserve their independence ; officers, scholars,
and even the clergy themselves, are seen vo-
luntarily working at the entrenchments, and
many of the Nobles are paying into the
national banks the most munificent subscrip-
tions, in the shape of money and jewels. The
insurrection is openly proclaiming in all parts
of the kingdom, the Jewish population of which
is arming with extraordinary zeal. The Provi-
sional Government of Warsaw has been dis-
solved, and a National Council appointed in its
stead, of which Prince ADAM CZARTORYSKI
is President.

ST. PETERSBURGII, DEC. 15.-His Majesty the Em-
peror, by an ukase of the 13th instant, has given to Field-
Marshal Count Diebitsch the chief command of the army
which is assembling on the western frontier of the empire,
with all the powers and prerogatives attached to that office.
At the same time his Majesty has declared the Govern-
ments of Grodno, Wilna, Minsk, Podolia, and Volhynia,
and also the province of Byalistock, in a state of war, and
placed them under the administration of the Commander-
in-Chief. The army in the field will consist of the de-
tached corps of the Grenadiers, the Ist awl 2d corps of
Infantry, the 3d and sth corps of the reserve Cavalry,
and the detached Lithuanian corps, which, with all the
troops belonging to it, will constitute the Gth corps of In-
fantry. The Adjutant-General Count Toll, General of
Infantry, is appointed Chief of the Staff of the Army in
the field.

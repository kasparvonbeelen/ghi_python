WONDERFUL ESCAPE.--Extract from a let-
ter from an officer on board the Imogene, dated April 4,
1832, four miles from Trincomalee :—" On the 27th of
last month, I witnessed an instance of heroism of which I
think an Englishman is alone capable. ROWE, a fore-top
man, was standing on the main yard, when he saw a man
of the name of WILSON, fall off the bowsprit. The ship
was going at the rate
iof nine knots. Without saying a.
word Row plunged n after him, and by his presence of
mind and exertions encouraged the poor fellow so effec-
tually, that much to the surprise of all they were both
picked up alive and uninjured. The ship had passed
over Wir.soff, and this is perhaps the first instance in
which a man bas been saved under similar circumstances, i
for on rising to the surface the head generally comes n
contact with the bottom of the vessel, and the person
is immediately stunnal."—Ply.motith and Devonport
Journal.

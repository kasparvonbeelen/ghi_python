MOLDAVIA AND WALLACHIA.

General Kisseleff, appointed President of the
Divan:of both Principalities since the death of Count
Soltuschin, passed the Danube, at Sistow, on the
20th Nov., and went to Ghiurgevo, and intended to
arrive at Bucharest on the 24th. In all the mer-
cantile towns of that country General Kisseleff an-
nounced the freedom of trade on the Danube, and
also the free exportation of salt from Wallachia.
This last measure has caused great satisfaction and
joy among the who began to suffer from a
scarcity of that article.
The corps stationed before Shunda and the second
corps, under General Pollen, . have both received
orders to set out on their march back to Russia.

After the evacuation of Adrianople the Russian
head-quarters were to be removed to Selimoro, there
to remain for the winter.

The cold weather having set in with great se-
verity,hopes are entertained in the Principalities that
it will have a salutary effect in stopping the ravages
of the plague.

New York Papers to the 25th November
have been received, but they contain no news.
The decree of the Mexican PRESIDENT for
abolishing slavery has, we rather suspect, ap-
peared in the American Papers already. The
articles are,—

" 1. Slavery is for ever abolished in the Re-

public.

" 2. Consequently all those individuals who'
until this day, looked upon themselves as slaves,

are free.

" 3. When the financial situation of tl►e _Re-
public admit, the proprietors of slaves shall be
indemnified, and the indemnification regulated

by a law.

" And, in order that the present decree may
have its full and entire execution, I order it to
be printed, published, and circulated to all those
whose obligation it is to have it fulfilled.
" Given in the Federal Palace of Mexico, on
the 15th of September, 1529.

" VIGENTO GUERRERO.

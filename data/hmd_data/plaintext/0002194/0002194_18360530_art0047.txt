Mr. O'CONNELL, in moving the Order of the Day for
resuming the debate on the subject of the petition which he
had presented, which was in substance, though not in form,
an election petition, wished to call the attention of the House
to the state of the facts. At the last Dublin Election, two
gentlemen were returned as duly elected. A petition was
presented from certain electors against that return, praying for
a scrutiny, and the substitution of the defeated candidates.
To that petition the defeated candidates were no parties—it
was merely the petition of electors. On that petition being
presented it was referred to a Committee, who determined that
the evidence should be taken in Dublin. When the Committee
came to this determination the evidence must be taken before
a Commission appointed under the Act enabling Committees
to send Commissions to Ireland. The Commissioners ap-
pointed by the Committee were bound to limit and confine
the point on which evidence was to be given. The Committee
among the limitations made on that occasion, made the 16th
rule in the words which he would read to the House.
It was as follows : " That no recriminatory evidence
be admitted against the defeated candidates, except
as far as regards the disqualification of voters, they not
being petitioners, nor any parties before the Committee."
He had called the attention of the House to the fact
that the petitioners 'had disclaimed the candidates as
parties ; that they called on the Committee to decide
they were not parties, and to draw the inevitable
inference that no evidence could be given affecting them
personally; and the Committee bad accordingly unanimously
so decided. Now, upon these factsthere was not the least doubt
that the petition prayed a substitution and a scrutiny; that it
charged bribery and intimidation on the part of the sitting Mem-
bers; that the statements!on the otherhand retorted those char-
ges, and the petitioners came forward before. the Committee,
and insisted that the Committee should determine that
the unsuccessful candidates were not parties .before them,
and that consequently the evidence should be so limited. The
unsuccessful candidate remained scaithless completely, and no
evidence could be adduced against them. There was no
exaggeration of that fact, because a Member of the House had
stated that that distinction had been distinctly come to and
acted upon by the Committee. He had only one more fact to
state, and that was, that there were eight persons struck off the
poll, for having been promised money before they voted, for
their votes, and having been subsequently paid for their
votes after they had voted. The fact, therefore, of bribery
having existed was so clear that it could not be disputed.
The facts which would bring that bribery home personally to
the now sitting Members were equally clear; so that if the
House was compelled to decide, this evidence was not to be
gone into, it might suppose the case of sitting Members
having given these bribes themselves, having actually made'
the promise, and performed the promise, and yet that was a
case in which there was no kind f remedy whatever.
Some of those persons who opposed the motion on this ground,
might perhaps one day fill the highest judicial offices, and
would it not be considered monstrous if such doe rine was to
to be held by them in their official capacity ? He would only
refer the House to the statutes under which this decision had
been read. The case turns upon two acts. The 9th Geo.
IV. cap. 32, and the 42d Geo. 111. cap. 106. This was the
Statute which gave legal power to appoint Commissions
the words of which he would just read to the Hon-e. . The
Hon. Member then read the _ clause. By this clause the
Committee were empowered to appoint limitation with respect
to the facts which the Commissioners were to try. The Com-
mittee accordingly, acting under the powers of this clause,
limits the inquiry as to the fact by excluding evidence
upon the point to which he had referred.—(Hear, hear.)
He would then come to the 9th Geo. I V., which was said to
be the perfection of legislation.—( Hear, hear.) It was al-
leged that this statute made the decision of the Committee
final, and that therefore no more evidence could be let in
against the parties. Could any proposition be more monstrous?
The clauses enacted that the Committee were to decide whe-
ther the petitioners or the sitting Members were duly elected,
and that such a decision should be final between the parties.
The House was now called upon to declare that the decision
of the Committee was to be final between persons
who werC no parties before the Committee. The
Committee lied decided that the present sitting Members were
no parties before them, and refused, upon that ground to hear
evidence against them. H • hoped, therefore, that party spirit
would never induce that House to depart so far from what was
the clear intention of the Legislature.- The Legislature stopped
there, and now it was attempted to carry the principle much
further by construction. This Act was called the per-
fection of. legislation. Now, what did the Act say ?
It provided that 11 MemlK•rs should be chosen as a Commit-
.% The 11 w-ere to retire and choose a Chairman, and then
provided that, in ca.e those eleven should vote equal—( A
eue"i)—there was a statute for them.—(Much laugh-
.) He contended that the 40th section did not
nelude the present case—it expressly excluded it, and
,here was no ground why the petition cf his (Mr. O'C.'s)
fete constituents, or those who voted
,for him—they
certainly did not vote for the present Members—should not
be received—why a Committee should not be appointed, and
an investigatiot had, as to oho committed the bribery. There
had been an allegation of bribery against him, and the witness
who had been produced to sustain it was now under sentence for
perjury : that was a tolerable refetat:on oft, echarge. Ail the pe-
titioners dcsiredwas investigation,and it was the duty of the House
to inquire whether the bribery happened by accident, or whether
there had been hands to set it in motion. That investigation
might not be very convenient for—he did not allude to the
sitting Members--but a gentleman of the Irish bar, whose
h Ind-writing made a portion of tile evidence by which
some of the voters had been struck off.—( Hear, hear.) It,
intht also be inconvenient for some persons en that side
of the water, for thousands do not fly over without some
persons to send them across. He had confined himself to the
very point before the House, and the only question was whe-
ther the statute carried it ao far. It had been as-
serted that the Canterbury case was a decision against him.
What was decided in that case? That the petitioner ought to
have been returned, and that the sitting Member was not
duly admitted. Now he would ask, ought any man to have
been returned who was not duly elected ?—( Hear, hear, and
a laugh.) If he (Mr. O'Connell) was in a Court of Jus-
tice, he would laugh to scorn the pitiful chicanery that
made such a distinction, and would consider such a
decision final and conclusive between the parties.—( Hear.)
He admitted that this was not a final decision, because it did
not include all the particulars. But it did not follow that this
decision was a decision under the Act. The Canterbury case
met this. There was a class of cases that did not come
within the finality of the statute, and this was one of them.
He had laid the case of these electors before the House,
and he trusted that there could be no reasonable doubt that the
House would take care that what ought to be investigated
should be investigated. He did not of course suspect that either
of the gentlemen the defeated candidates had themselves
bribed, but there was no doubt that bribery existed, whatever
doubt there might be as to the quarters from whence the
money came. That money had been found by some party was
perfectly clear, and the only question was, whether under the
circumstances, the House would send back the petition to the
Committee to review their decision.
The ATTORNEY-GENERAL thought that this peti-
tion could not be received. He had felt it his duty most at-
tentively to consider the case, and he felt no difficulty in ac-
knowledging that it was with very great reluctance that he
had arrived at this conclusion.
Mr. O'CONNELL rose amidst tremendous cries of
" Chair " and " Order," from the Opposition benches). He
wished to say but one word.—(Cries of " Spoke.") It would
save the time of the House.—( Great uproar.) He wished to
withdraw the petition.—(Cheers from the Opposition.) He
wished to withdraw the petition is, whatever his own opinion
might be, the principle law officer of the Crown having
pledged his legal reputation to a contrary opinion, he did
not think that he (Mr:. O'Connell) onght to interfere.
The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said that his opinion
went for nothing, and he was, therefore, anxious that it should
jle contradicted or corroborated by that of the chair.—(Hear.)
'• The SPEAKER said this was aquestion of great importance,
and he felt difficulty in stating his opinion upon it. It divided
itself ;into two points. When an election took place it
was competetent for the electors or the unsuccessful
candidates to present a petition, but in any case it
was to be considered that the electors were the
substantial parties whether the petition presented claimed the
seat or not--whether it was the petition of electors or
unsuccessful candidates, it was quite competent in. either
case for the Committee to come to a conclusion that the
unsuccessful candidates had a right to be returned as
duly elected.—( Hear, hear, hear.) If this was true
it followed that on a question affecting the right of
either party to his seat, the whole of the facts ought to be
brought under the consideration of the Committee. How
could the Committee conscientiously make their report, if they
shut out any part of the evidence—they could not give a
proper decision unless every part of the evidence affecting
the right of either party was duly considered and
discussed. The eight Hon. Gentlemen referred at some
length to the petition presented in 1833, complaining of the
return made for Southampton respecting the question how far
the decision was to to be considered a final decision ; he
was of opinion that it must be taken as final.—(Hear,
hear, hear.) It followed that if the Committee had
come to an erroneous opinion when they decided that the
unsuccessful candidates were not parties before the Committee
—that decision the House could not be called upon to reverse.
He was only discharging his duty which he owed to the
House, when he stated that he was of opinion that prin-
ciple ought to prevail against particular circunotance,

Mr. HARDY presented a petition from the Protestants of
---, complaining of a departure from the principles
of the Constitution on the part of the House in many
of its late Acts. They took notice of the Acts for the
relict' of the Dissenters—of the Catholics ; and there they
found that those to whom power was granted were, under the
obligation of an oath, bound not to do anything which would
disturb or weaken the Protestant religion as by law established
in 1653—they had taken pains to find out what those princi-
ples were, ar:d they found that it was a firm protest against
the doctrines cf the Church of Rome, which were then held
to be idolatrous and hateful ; yet the House were in the yearly
habit of making grants to Mavnooth College, where those
who were to disseminate those drrors received that education
which fitted them for the office. They prayed that the grant
may he discontinued.
Mr. BROWN presented a petition from Mayo, praying for
the Total Abolition of Tithes.

Mr. FRENCH presented a petition from an Irish Bar-
rister named O'Malley Irwin, complaining of a verdict that
ha'l been given against him on a misdemeanour, in en-
deavouring to procure himself to be elected assistant
barrister. Ihe petitioner also complained of the non-
attendance of Lord Hatherton, who was then Irish Secretary,
at the trial. The petitioner prayed that the House would take
,his case into its serious consideration. Ile wished it to be un-
derstood, that before presenting this petition, he had given
notice of it to his Majesty's Government. He could not hold
himself responsible for the statements contained in the peti-
tion, as he bad no knowledge of them ; but as the petitioner
belonged to a very respectable family in the county which he
represented, he thought it his duty to present the petition.
Mr. O'LOGHLEN said that this petition contained a
charge against the officers of his Majesty's Government. The
facts of the case were these—the petitioner was indicted for
forging the resignation, or what purported to be the resigna-
tion of Mr. Johnson, the assistant barrister of the county of
Mayo, in order to get the appointment for himself. He was
brought to trial under the administration of the Right Ho-
nourable Bart ( Sir R. Peel), and found guilty of forging
the document. The petitioner applied to the Court of King's
Bench to set aside the verdict—not upon the ground of his
witnesses not being in attendance, but because a certain docu-
ment was not sufficiently brought under the consideration of
the Jury. He was tried a second time, and not having made
any application to postpone the trial, he was a second time
found guilty, and an application to set aside the verdict having
been refused, the petitioner was sentenced, and justly sen-
tenced, to an imprisonment for nine months.

TRADE WITH THE CAPE COAST.

We cannot too earnestly impress on Reformers the
imuortance of discountenancing all attempts, at a crisis
like the present, to produce disunion in the body.
There can be but one opinion among them as to the
conduct pursued by the House of Lords, though all
may not be equally agreed as to the measure necessary
for remedying the defects of that branch of the Legis-
lature. We ourselves are satisfied that till the Lords
be reformed, they will constantly oppose every Admi-
nistration honestly disposed towards the people ; but
e are well aware that many sincere Reformers are yet
unprepared to embrace the conclusions to which such
a conviction necessarily points. The question, how-
ever, as we have already observed, is one fairly
open for discussion ; and we cannot, therefore, antici-
pate the possibility of any honest Reformer supporting
the insulting proposition of Mr. G. Price ; which, if
aareed to, would grievously lower the House of Com-
mons in the estimation of the country. The Tories would
no doubt be rejoiced to see the Reformers at variance
among themselves ; but Reformers wili be careful to
avoid such courses as might have a tendency to afford
that satisfaction to their opponents. The most dan-
gerous enemies are those of a man's own house ; and
the pretended Reformer, who shapes his conduct so as
to promote the views of the Tories, ought to be un
masked without scruple or delicacy. We care not how
high or exalted the , parties may be from which mis-
chievous advice may come; they must be treated ac-
cording to their deserts. If those whose names we
have been accustomed to associate with the proudest
exertions in favour of liberty should sully their fair
fame by indulging in unworthy jealousies, care must
be taken that the cause of reform be not sacrificed
from any delicacy to individuals. History will do
justice to their services- in the cause of liberty ; it is
our part to see that a reputation obtained by these
services may not be turned against the people.
The subject, however, which first claims our
consideration, is the reception the Commons may give
to the destructive Bill of the Lords. The people cer-
tainly expect from their Representatives that they will
act with the spirit and determination which the crisis
demands. Any appearance of faint-heartedness would
be productive of incalculable mischief. If the Com-
mons give way in the least, if they appear to treat
lightly 'the insult to them by the Lords, they will sink
in the esteem of the people, and the Lords will be
tempted, by the success of their experiment, to humi-
live them still more. It should be kept constantly in
mind by Reform Members, that all attempts to screen
the Lards are deductions from their own reputation.
The dictates of the most common prudence prescribe
a bold Nand resolute course as the only one which is
safe. -To yield would not obtain for them the credit
of moderation, but would, on the contrary, proclaim
an infirmity of purpose, which the Lords would know
how to turn to account. But we cannot for a moment
suppose that Ministers will recommend any course in-
compatible with the dignity of the representatives of the
people. The language of Lord Holland and Lord
Lansdowne, forbid our entertaining for a moment the
suspicion that they will abandon -the high ground
they have taken, and lay the Commons prostrate at
the feet of the Peers. We cannot suppose that they
will disappoint the expectations of the people. They
must kuow even that were they themselves disposed to
forget what is due to their own reputation and the cha-
racter of the House, their recommendation would be
indignantly spurned by a great body of Reform Mem-
bers, and that the duration of a Ministry reduced to
rely for support on its political opponents, must be
brief indeed. The people of these kingdoms have
certainly shown no impatience with respect to the trial
of the Lords. On the contrary, from various causes,
there has been manifested a constant disposition to
overlook their faults, and to believe in the possibility
of their amendment. However, the conviction has
now become universal that the Peers will always use

SAN SEBASTIAN, MAY 19.—The Royal Tar
steamer has just arrived from Falmouth, with 150 recruits for
the Legion. She has also brought out some medical officers
and stores. The Isabell 11. steamer, Commodore Henry
(Spanish service), is going round to-night or early to-morrow
morning to Socoa, to take on board General Jaureguy and
1,200 Spanish troops. After some correspondence with Ge-
neral Harispe and telegraphic communications with the French
Government, these men have been permitted to march across
gaer
the French territory, and to embark. for San Sebastian from a
French port. The men did not marchgeinwFargagnocnes.wityh

men; I have already mentioned that about 60 of the marine ar-
tillery bad arrived; they are lodged in the house where I live,
and a finer or more orderly detachment does not exist any-
where. Thus a very considerable and most efficient force
will in twenty-four hours be assembled in San Sebas-
tian, under the orders of General Evans ; and it is my firm
persuasion that in my next I shall have the happiness of in-
forming you that another deadly blow has been struck at the
Carlists in this quarter. Not a moment has been lost since

is in a great state of
forwardness; this, together with a four-pounder swivel, which
is to be mounted on the summit of the windmill, thus answering
to our martello-towers, will completely insure the respectful
distance of the Carlists on the land side ; whilst two heavy
guns, which have been mounted by the British Navy in the
islet of the Santa Clara, will give double security and cone-
fidenee to the inhabitants of San Sebastian.

THE DESTRUCTIVE FIRE- AT WINDSOR.—The juris•
diction of Mayor as Coroner for the Borough having
ceased when the town was temporarily deprived of the
Court of Quarter Scss:ons, and the warrant conferring the
powers afresh not having yet been granted, it was necessary
to summon the County Coroner to hold the inquests on the
bodies of the unfortunate persons who perished in the
flames. _As, _ •
J. Ford, ZNew-:Windsor, grocer, deposed as follows :
On MondaY7last.,:the inmates of my house were myself, my
wife, my servhntsmaid, whom we call Susan, but I bereve
her name is Martha; Joseph King, the principal shopman,
about twenty-one ye,ars of age ; Joseph Deane, an appren-
tice, aged about seventeen. ; John Head, the porter,
aged about twenty ; Wm. Southwood, an apprentice, aged
about sixteen ; and J. Nye, an apprentice, aged eighteen.
The three missing are Deane, Southwood, and Nye. We
were all in bed by a quarter-past ten o'clock on Monday
night. The young men bad a candle in each room. We
all got up at one time. The five young men retired toge-
ther, and I followed them. Mrs. Ford had gone to bed
before, as was usual—l rather- think the servant went first.
None of them slept in a back room. In about an hour I
was awoke by Mrs. Ford, -ivh-o said she heard a cry of fire,
and then I found that the room was full of smoke. Mrs.
Ford threw up the window, and went into the passage.
From the groat agitation in which I was I scarcely knew what
I did, but I went into the servant's room, and pulled her
out of bed, and told her to get up directly. As I came
out of that room I met such volumes of smoke that I could
scarcely breathe, and I n•ent to my own room, and found
Mrs. Ford endeavouring to dress herself. King tells me I
called the young men, but I do not recollect it, because I
was so much alarmed. I heard Mrs. Ford crying out she
was suffocated, and I went to her. I knew some of the
young men were down, and I pushed them into the room.
I found it was impossible to get down stairs, and I thought
all the inmates had come down. I and my wife and maid-
servant, with only two of the young men, King and Deane,
as it appeared, got out of the side window. I expected all
of them had escaped, but fearing they had not, King says
I went back again to call them. King, Dean, the maid-
servant, my wife, and myself got out on the leads, consi-
derably below the sill of the window, thence to the other
houses. I had only my trowsers on and no shoes. I don't
think I had any stockings on, but am not positive. My
wife had nothinc, but her night clothes on, and she pulled a
counterpane off bed and threw it about her. The ser-
vant had her gown on when I first noticed her. I am in-
sured, but I really don't know the office. The house is not
my own. Mr. Miller and Mr. Barton are the agents for the
two insurance offices. I insured with Mr. Miller at the old
shop for 3001. furniture and 400/. stock. Afterwards the
chimney caught fire, and 'Airs. Ford advised me to increase
the insurance. My stock, furniture, and plate, were con-
sequently insured for 1,2001. The amount in Mr. Miller's
office (the Protector) is
.7001., and 5001. with Mr. Barton
(in the Royal Exchange.) I increased my insurance from
having moved from a small house to a larger one. I had
great difficulty in putting the females over the first roof,
and was obliged to get them to stride, and then some of
the fire actually dropped on us.
Joseph King, the shopnian, corroborated the evidence of
Mr. Ford.
The Jury returned a verdict that the deceased had come
by their death accidentally, and expressed their opinion that
no blame could be attached to Mr. Ford.
INTERMENT OF THE BODIES.—On Saturday evening, at
half-past seven o'clock, the funeral took place. The remains
of the unfortunate deceased persons, all of whom were
horribly burned, were placed in one coffin and conveyed to
New Windsor Church, followed by several mourners—
among whom was Mr. Ford, who seemed deeply affected.

Sir R. PEEL said he had a petition to present of rather
a peculiar nature. It had come to him, accompanied with a
letter through the Post-office, and he had no doubt of the•ge-
nuineness of the document. The petition was addressed to
the House of Commons, and was signed by Prince —,
on behalf of the inhabitants of Cape Coast. The Prince
expressed great gratitude to the House for the vast benefits
they had conferred on the black population of the world by
the abolition of negro slavery; the principal object of the
petition was, that the House of Commons would take mea-
sures to secure the natives of the neighbourhood of Cape
Coast Castle the benefits of free trade, or prevent the mer-
chants of Cape Castle from interfering- to prevent the free
traders of Bristol and from affording the natives
the commodities they wanted at a much cheaper rate than
they (the merchants) would do. The Prince stated himself
to be an ally of England, and had sent the petition to that
officer who could best forward their interests.—(A laugh.)
He was sure that the House would not receive the petition
with levity—( Hear, hear),—as it was on the subject of the
commerce of the country.—Laid on the table.
TAXES ON KNOWLEDGE.
Mr. HUME presented petitions from the jewellers of
Clerkenwell, the hatters of the metropolis, the copper-plate
printers, the society of carpenters of Holborn, the paper-
makers, the shoemakers, the masons of Westminster; from
certain inhabitants of London ; from Christ Church, Sur-
rey; from Islington ; from Aldersgate ; from three Societies
in Lambeth ; and from Fethard, in the county Tipperary—all
praying for the abolition of stamp duties on newspapers. The
petitioners regretted that his Majesty's Government had so far
violated the rights of British subjects as to employ spies for

A man Li;Liif4lzillins was charged with sending
begging letters to various noblemen and gentlemen, among
whom were the Earl of Dartmouth, General Bligh, Lord
Morpeth, Lord Viscount Belgrave, Earl Hardwicke, and
others. He was remanded.

QUEEN- S QU ARE.
On Saturday a young Frenchman, of very dashing exte-
rior, who was remanded from the preceding Saturday, and
who gave his name Louis Breton, was re-examined before
Messrs. Gregorie and White, charged with having commit-
ted several robberies at the Italian Opera-house. He was
taken into custody on Friday night week, at the theatre,
for robbing Charles Fitzgerald, Esq., of Parliament-Areet,
Westminster, of his purse, containing a number of sove-
reigns. Upon the present occasion, Richard Cross, a
waiter to Mr. Dubourg, the keeper of the refreshment-
room, stated that just before Read took the prisoner into
custody, he served him with some refreshment, and upon
giving him the change of a sovereign, he observed him throw
something under the table, which proved to be the purse of
Mr. Fitzgerald.
Read was sworn, and stated that he had examined the
prisoner's lodgings minutely, and had found several pawn-
brokers' duplicates, two of which were for valuable snuff-
boxes ; one was pledged at Vaughan's, 39, Strand, on the
10th, and the other at Walter's, Holborn, on the 16th inst.,
and, from the devices on them, they are supposed to belong

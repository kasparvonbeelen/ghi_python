14.7* yesterday stated at length our reasons
,for
doubting the very-unfavourable intelligence Which
arrived lately from the Continent, and al though private
accounts reached town last niglii,,witiCh Appear...to
confirm the reports of the total taut of the Austrian
Army, we 'still think there are.strong'reations fbr not
giving credit to them, at least- to their full extent'.
It r, illl bo recolletled, that the' first account at
the defeat ,and surrender, of the Austrian Army
appeared in . the- Gazette de FrAnce of the 22d
; but it w,a3 not given- in an official shape.
11)e 0n w,hicli the Prod 41.aion took place is
isot mentioned, and what is still stranger, the
.11187riteur of the same day, though it states that un-
•
Vide-Letters confirm the; Capture of Ulm, does
net' Bay a V.;orrl of the total Surrender of the Austrian
Army. Thus stands' the intelligence as far as re-
lates to the French Papers;:bgt it, is said, to -be .
fully--eeriftmetl- by Letters received from Holland.
That sticJi ,4 fp9ort,syas ciroulated,, andmight have
obtained credit, in Holland; we do not. deny; but
1c.146w thg 'the fir,'it areounts vvliich reached us
from- Ijoliand of tho defeat of . the Austrians,
ilia the
„capture 'of -Ulm', 'could not be true ;
we are therefbre justified in doubting those which
14ie been subsequently received, until they are-con-z-
-firmed by intelligence. `'The fast account
the ipaptinu of Ulmn from Holland was con-
tained ha aLetter .which we received and published
ow,gtxpr:44 Edition on Siiturdai afternoon. This
letter Was dated Rotterdaull, the 21st wit: but since
w'e have received Dutch Papers to the 27th,
which• contain no account of the defeat of the Au.
I,4trian'.4rtriy, and only mention thec.;aPture of I,llra

74, ka repoyt, in a TA4tvr. front 'Frankfort, dated
'the' -cit)th,' Now it seettis almost. inwnssihle that

intelligence bitould Nave reached Rotterdam Ott the
it "of the' Deleit of .the Alisiriabs and the taking
5f 171ni, and th.te such important events should not'
•ave been known at: Fnmkfort on thu 5;01.h. It is
.h
pow that the aEtion took .place on the t oth,. that
obstiiiatc l'ittacks, in which tho French
:-.x.ffe red ekecedingly, they succeeded in taking Uirri7--
that General MAcit and 413 while; Staff were made
Pri,soners, and the Austrian Army entirely
nod. If this were true, it ccroinly could not have
CrYin at licitterd 3111 on the 21st. Men the
intelligence of 'the ';1 1 3r, from Il olland, was fabil.
cited, it ought Make us cautious in giving credit
to that, of a hubsecitivt 'date; \viiich hears no more
itotornal Marks datithencicity.
NiVe stated yesterday that a grand salute had been
tiNd at .13(4n1e-42,ne on tiattirclay, and that it was re-
ported to have taken place on account of the total
t!ete4t of the Austihins VITh. We now learathat
a Boat •was sent adrift 4410 Boulogne, which, on
being picked up. by the :bnotortaliti! Frigate, ,was

Zc: is scarcebr necessary to observe, that
urn' Onicated such a way is not worthy

of ratxcli credit, or, at any rate, ought to be received
with'rauch caution and suspicion. The annihilation

cis , u PP. . ,
}Az' dear id the 44,aa vie .tated yesterday, speaks of,
fitlinP
nstriah Troops having gained the; left link of
,
iyintit,e where they intercepto the French
ltlP ,
poprieri, circunqstance, atTang ty

timed in the Moniteur, is confirmed by Let-
ters from. Trankfert of the Voth instant, which
state, that a Corps of Austrians, • limier , the
Archduke FEttrsoram, had passed over the Da-
ntibe from Ulm intou-the Tvitories of Wurtem-
burgh. This is certainly inconsistent with the
pompous account of the annihilation of the Aus-
trian Army. :If the French have taken Ultns it
is not improbable that the capture may have
taken place after the greater 'part of the Austrians
had quitted the place; and when only a Garrison of
four or five•thousand, men were left to defend it.'
The Capture Ofinni in this Way would be of little
consequence, as the French, probably, with the ae
cumulating force in their rear, could not long keep
it. That an Anstrian Army of forty or fifty thou-
sand ineii should IeAVC laid down their arms and iinr-
rendrecl, appears atale too improbable to be believed
even by the most credulous, without at least some
better authority for it than there is at present. The
acknowledgement of the libmiteur,
,that the French.
Couriers' Were intercepted by the Austrian Troops
on the left Bank of the Danube, evidently itn-
Old that they: were 'not in: :that .situation'
which could induce
.the Surrender of 'Forty or
• Fifty Thousand Men. What was to hinder the
from marching along the left Bank of the
Danube, , and again re-crossing it in the rear of the,
positiOns which the French heidaccording to the last
accouuts ? It appears that the Sunaioriofthe first Rui-
sian Column with a body of A.ustrians (probably that
under Gett.KtsNstaA Eft) took place on the Inn on the
12tit inst. This united Army, 'consisting of UpWards
of 70,000 men, 'would be strong ettengh. to advance
towards the positions of the French, from which
they,Could not be fig distant on the teth. Nothing,,
therefore, hot the 'utter defeat of the , Austrians
could prevent BONAPARTE from :being Placed in a
situation of the utmost peril and 'hazard. lie would
therefore doubtless Make a great Sacrifice of men
to obtain such a viapry, and. if he has achieved
it, wt have little • doubt that his loss was at least
equal, if not greater, than, that of the Austrians ;
indeed the reports of the Action seem to agree in
stating his loss to be very great. , Even therefore if
he 'succeeded in forcing thC Austrian POstii (which it
would be idle to suppose were not Most bravely
end resolutely defended), and thereby obtaining
a great v4lory, his Army must be ',so much crippled
to render it little able to meet, with any chance
of success, a formidable. Army of Russians coming
fresh into the Field: Marshal AooKa eau, itis said,
had passed the Rhine at linningen, and. was march-
ing through the Black Forest, having arrived in the
neighbourhood 'of Schaffhausen on the 7th. The
Austrian General Gorp&suctst wts, 110WCVei, post-
ed at Stockach to keep AuGanisu in check, and
there is not the least. authority for . supposing that
the former has been forced from his pdsition.

We cunnot,,,from the Nkitoie view of the stlb:ma,
bring anrselves to'bolieve, without-innch more' 41-
thentic information, that elteAusfrians have sustain-
ed that disaster, which the French would make us
believe ; and oven if ,they.

The accession of the Ptussian Alonarch to the

" Ile passage of the Danube, at Cv'untthurgh,
occasioned a smart engagement. The Austrians
kept up a destructive tire of grape-shot ;* but the
lA.ench swam over the 'river during the night, and
Ultimately gained the end for which they had been
making vain efforts all day long ; they entered that
city on the following day at noon, after it ha'd been
evacuated by the Austrians at ten. Both the
Archduke FEIWINAND and General MACK were
present.
" On the i Ith the French attempted to make
themselves masters of Ulm ; but. in this they did
not succeed, notwithstanding their brave attack and -
!Gate loss, The attack, however, appears to have
betn renewed afterwards, and Ulm, according to
sell accounts, has fallen into the hands of the
Yrench; in consequence of which the Corps which
144 P.r.ased the Danube front Ulm on the 13th, tin-
.

an 'unintentional error, „sod not a false return. The

While l)eunelong, the Eotany gay Chief, was in

Vour which the' fashionable_ world lavishes on ever.
novelty. ;The following account ofhim after his re.,
turn to his oWn Country, from a voyage lately pub-
Wiled, may not beuninteresting':
'" While in this Country he was presented to tnAiy
of the principal Nobility and first Families in the
Kingdom, and received from many of them presents
of cloth and otb4articlei, whip h a savage of any other
Country would have deemed inestimable. It was
not.so, however, with liennelongi he was no sooner
re-landed in his oWn Country, thanha;forgot, 'or at
least laid aside all the artiaments ar improvements
lie had reaped from his travels, and returned with
increased relish to his 'savage' habits. Ftea Clothes
were thrown .away, and he again became-its coin
plete a New Hollander as if he had never left his
native

"'lt must not, however, be denied, that Benne-
long is somewhat advanced beyond -hii Coinitry, as
„
he eau ,occastoneny converse 'with' ease and interest.
The names of Lady Sidney and Lady. Jane Dundas.
are often in his mouth, and he appears justly grateful
for favours received from them. It is not unpleasing
to listen to his account of the wonders he has seen
in England.
" One incident he relates with all the satisfaction
of a tayourite story i that of being at the house of
a respeetable Gentleman, and Surrounded .with
curious visitori, When an ola 'Gentleman, unmoved
amidst the gcmiral eagerness, took no-further notive
or him than bra single glance, and then, 'helplng.
hiniselfto a pinch of snuff, requested the company
to pass the bottle. 'Mill gravity and apathy seem to
have made a greater imprmsion on the mind 4.4
Bennelong than all the wonders. he had seen and 'he
considers the old Gentleman as, perhaps, the,wiSest
man in England.
He is still so addiCted.to drinking, that ha would
never be sober if ha could obtain liqoor, .and when
intoxicated he is intolerably trtiv:hievotta. He is, in
truth, a savage beyond all hopes of amelioration by
culture, and was, at the time of our ant to
Cavently, as incorrigible."

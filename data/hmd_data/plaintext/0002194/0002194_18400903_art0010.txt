It can be proved that the profits of cultivating Sugar in
India, by the employment of the liill Coolies in their own
country, instead of transporting them to the Mauritius, or
other British colonies, will be nesrly cent. per cent., while the
adoption of the system on a large scale will tend more to the
abolition of slavery, both open and covert, than any other
practical plan yet adopted.
The Shires are made of small amount, in order that the
greatest possible number may be able to possess them, and thus
be interested in the sale of Sugar produced by free-labour.
Prospectuses, Estimates, the names of the Directors, and any
further particulars, may be had on application to the Secre-
tary or the Solicitors.

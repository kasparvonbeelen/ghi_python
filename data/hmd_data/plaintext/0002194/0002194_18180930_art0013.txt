POLICE INTLLLIGENCE.

CASE OF GREAT PUBLIC IMPORTANCE.-ABUSES IN

THE COAL THADE.

GUILDHALL.-Yesterday a case of great
im-
pottance to all classes of the community came on
at this oflice. It was a prosecution instituted by
the Governor and Company of the Bank ofEng-
land, against Mr. John Johnson, of South Lam-
beth, an eminent coal-merchant, for a non-com-
piimice with the regulations laid down in the
statute of the 47th of the present King. The in-
formations contained 48 counts. The first count
charged the 'defendant with selling and delivering
coals without the meter's ticket, and the remaining
counts with doing so without furnishing t he vender's
ticket, countersigned by the meter, as required by
,she Act mentioned. Mr. Freshfield, of the house of
Kaye and 14'reshfirld, attended for the Bank of En;-
.land. Mr. Freshfield be!7ged it to be distinctly
understood, that .they were not actuated by
vindictive motives. The only object the Bank had
in view was the protection of the Public, and al-
though the defendant bad incurred penalties
amounting to 970/. they would be,quite satisfied,
and their object as well anSwered, by a single con-
viction, and a single penalty even of one shilling•
In t he 47th year of the present reign it was thought
necessary to pass an Act for the protection of the
public against the fraud) practised in the coal
tritde. This Act required that coals should he
sold only in the regular coal-market, and the
venders thereof were subject to a penalty of one
hundred pounds shonld they refuse.to sell them
to any individual wishing to purchase. In the
next .place; in order to insure legal measure,
the vender was obliged, before the coals were con-
veyed away, to furnish a ticket front the meter,
certifying that he had surveyed and measured
them. Next, as to the quality of the coals, for
the protection of those who chose to have them
of a superior quality, for there was a variation in
the value of (coin eight to ten shillings per chal•-
dron, the following regulations were -laid down
in the Act : First, the " Fitter'' at the
place where a vessel took in her 'cargo was
required to furnish to the Captain a certificate
of the-quality of the coals with which the ship was
eighted. This certificate, on the atrival of the
vessel at the place of discharging her cargo,
was given to the meter, and the latter was bound
to furnish another certificate, stating into what
barge or barges the cargo was ..diseharged, and to
what wharf they were conveyed. Titus the chain
was carried from the very mine which produced
the coals to the vender of them. lii oilier, how-
ever, to continue the chain even to the purchaser
of the article, the vender was compelled to give a
certificate that the coals served to the ctistomer
were the same in quality as those ordered.—
This certificate, to prevent the possibility of (rand,
was to be countersigned by a meter. Ile (\lr.
Freshfield) would slim in evidence that improper
means bad been adopted to evade these regida-
(ions, lie should prove that tickets had been
furnished with the coals served by the defendant,
in which was inserted the name of an individual
who never existed as a coal meter. It could
also be proved, that the tickets thus furnished
were surreptitiously obtained, and that they
came ,vithout the meter's counter,ign. Mr.
Freshfield went on to state, that the coals served
by the defendant were deficient both in quantity
and, quality.
Mr. AtinuEWS having-intimated, that the de,
fendaut would plead guilty, Mr. Fut shfield ab-
stained from calling witnesses.
Considering all the circumstances of the case,
Sir CcAumus HUNT E R thought ptoper to tine
i\lr. Johnson ten on each information.
The whole ainom.ted to 251.

ANDkEws expressed his client satisfied.
Mr. rItE.SIiFIRLD said, that a moiety being the
property tit the informer, he- should thank the
illagis4rate to order one-half of that moiety to
the Spitalfrelds._ poor, and the other half to the
Sotio tot the Relict of Stn;ili Debtors.

Sir i.7} >vntus HUNTER very much, approved of
this conclusion. lie then desired it_ to be under-
stood, that in the event of any similar error upon
the part, of coal merchants, a wore heavy pe-
nalty should 'certainty be inflicted.—Mr.neslifield
did not press the costa- .

I.IDDEN, DEATU.—An Inquisition was taken
yesterday before Mr, SHELTON, Coroner, at Ihe
CriAwn, St. George7s-Aelds, near the Obelisk, on
the body of a young Plan, named Pavis, news-
twin, who resided in Gun-street, Southwark. 1t
was stated its evidence, that on Saturday morning
last the deceased left home for the purpose of
going to the different Newspaper Offices to frteh
some newspapers, and to pay for those he had re-
ceived during the
,Week. He had not walked a
hundred yards from his house, when he tell hacb-
wards and expired. The slim of 131.. was found
about his person. Verdict---" Died by the ViA-
tation of God."_.

EXTRACTS FROM "NEW REASONS 'FOR AEOLIS'HI,NG

THE SLAVE TRADE," CONTINUED.
The author, after the preliminary remarks 'ex-
tracted in the last number, proceeded to cite va-
rious passages of Scripture, as descriptive of those
cause-s fol. which the kchastisements• of Divine
Provideuce have been most usually inflicted upon

offending. nations. Ile sheweel from them that
the sins of oppression, injustice, and 'violence, 'to-
wards the poor and hetirtess, find the *shedding
of innocent blood, are the 1 provocations which,
that of idolatory excepted, are the most frequent-
ly and strongly denounced. But as 1 have al-
ready offered 'stone remarks of the same kind, and
quoted some of the same scriptural authorities,
will pass on to his applications of them.
" Were we, "continued he, " with such scrip-
tural precedents and explanations of the ways of
the Almighty before us, to search for the causes'
of the apparent displeasure of Heaven, it would
be natural to turn our eyes towards the Slave
Trade, on account •of the specific character of
the guilt which it involves ; even if its.enormous
mageitude did not pre-emineotly.challenge atten-
tion. It rapine, oppression, violence to the poor,
the stranger, and 'the destitute,' di,honest gain,
and the effusion of innocent ,blood, be put in in--
quest against England, where. will they be form&
but in the Slave Trade ; except indeed in its as-.
sodated iniquity, the dreadtul slavery of Co-
lonies !"
He enlarged upon this view of the subject,
vindicating the national character, as to the el,
fects of our Government in the East Indies, and
in other points, and :t ben proceeded• to consider
the degree and extent of the provocation.
" The magnitude of the crimes of the Slave
Trade, still more than their specific character,
will coniloct to the satne conclusion. Nearly
37,000 unfortunate inert, women, and chiidren,
are yearly carried by us front their native
.land to
a far distant country ; there to perish pi maturely,
or to end their days in hrtpelesS eafttivity• and
bondage. They have glycol's no offence ; they:
have for the most part committed
,no crime even
against their countrymett, worthy of exile or
slavery ; the motive of our transporting thcm; is
pure unqualified avarice. Yet by our hands, anti
by our procurement, the dearest tics of nature
are barbarously rent asunder ; the husband is
dragged from the aims of wife, the' innocent
child from the bosom of its •parents, and'the cries
of their agonized feelings. are ended only by the
silence of despair. At this. moment ten thousand
shrieks and groans, uttered by the hopeless vic-
tims of British violence, are' entering' the ear of
the Most High, the righteons..ludge of the whole
earth, and demandiug,veogeanee against us.
" our slave ships, like hungry vultures,
hover continually over the coasts of that hapless
continent, dreadful are the horrors in :the -tote.'

" The exportable slavery of Africa is, for the
most •part', the'prtlduce only Of'erita:s,.' wirieli We
directly or hulk ectly stiatulate,,tbe-wretched na-
tives to commit ; and, our; means, every spe,
cies of misery is continually propagated through
the gt eater part oaf:that vast continent. Treach-
ery, false accusation, man,stealing, midnight ra-
pine, and "Conflagratinn;'"Are ordinary Meauss
which, int aid of that more copious source,:eapti-
vity in war, our demand. for slaves is .supplied;
and while, I-4 the frequency of these crimes, man
becomes to man, a greate'r terror than the lion7of
the desert, to the destruction of all innocent
commerce, and civil intercourse, between indivi-
duals, hequent and dreadful wars ate kindled be-
tween their petty States, for the sole purpose of
obtaining captives to barterwith our merchants
for the: arms and luxuries of tirope.,
•
" Noe is war increased only in point of fre-
qrtency ; its hot rid feattires•ate rendered far 'mine

who, atter killing all tha,t,make resistance, carry

stores of the Atlantic from very remote parts of
interior cottony, and in their way have extensive
deserts to pass, where so manyexteroal;bardshipa
and sufferings are added to, the anguish, of their
minds, that, of those who originally set out for
the coast, a great number perish miserably on the

journey. •
" Exportable slavery, then, is not only the
fruit of atrocious crimes and exquisite wretched-
ness but this fruit is not, and, from the nature of
the case cannot be, thriftily gathered. The hope-
less,col.llllry ! for every bondsman placed ip the
hold o'fa.slave-ship is deprived of much more than
a single life.
" But a still further waste of human existence
rakes place .in that foul prison itself. The rtiOt

COLONIAL MARKETS.

To-day being the great day at Ascot, we have no public sales what-
ever; and as all the business now done is by public sale, there of course,
is next to nothing done by private contract. For to-morrow we have
advertized 11,000 bags Manilla Sugar; 700 bags Siam; 6,663 bags
Mauritius ; 150 hhds. new Barbadoes, and 1,700 bags Bengal. Coffee,
400 bags Sumatra ; 714 bags Ceylon, and 124 casks, and 169 bags
B.P. Cotton, 5,300 bales; 1,400 bags Saltpetre; and 429 chests
Cassia Lignea. The imports are rather heavy; the exports are light,
and the deliveries for home consumption good. The quantity of Tea ad-
vertised for the approaching sale is very large, amounting to nearly
13,000,000 lbs. •

MONEY AND COMMERCIAL NEWS

CITY (THIS DAY), TWELVE O'CLOCK,
We have received Hobart Town Papers to the 10th of Feb., from
which we extract the following :
" His Excellency and family arrived in town yesterday evening.
" In most parts of the interior the late crops have sustained conside.
rable damage by the frost.
" Considerable anxiety has of ►ate been felt on account of the sudden
death of several individuals well known in this town—Mrs. Peel, Miss
Watchorn, and Miss Rowland, were all in vigorous health a few days
before they quitted this sublunary aL•:le."
Van Diemen's Laud Papers received to the 10th February, state :

" The harbour of Hobart Town never presented such a splendid sight
as it has done during the last ten days, being almost full of shipping—
most of them three masted vessels. Amongst the number the French
King's corvette Heroine. and five Whalers of that nation.

On Wednesday last an inquest wai held on the .body
of Harriet Skipworth, aged 10 years, who was found dead on the road
in the parish of Halton, near Spilsby. It appeared that the deceased
had taken a tin bucket to water a mare having a foal, which she had
turned over her head to keep off the rain, when a splendid corruscation,
resembling a rocket, or pyramid of fire, was observed, which was instantly
r'll°wed by a most tremendous clap of thunder, and the child was seen
to fall. Upon going to ascertain the cause, some men found that life
was extinct, deceased having been struck by the electric fluid ; the con.
cussion was so great that it was: felt a considerable distance round by
labourers at work, who were thrown aF iinst each other. Upon the
Coroner and Jury going to view the body they found the chin and the
right side of the child considerable scathed and blackened, end her
clothes rent. The following verdict was returned :—" Died by the
visiting hand of Providence, having been struck by the electric fluid."

LORD BROUGHAM and MR. SMITE'

TO BENJA MIN SMITH, Eso., N. P.
DEAR Ma. B. SNIITIT,—I have seen this morning your new letter,
of which I should not have taken any notice, but for your strange asser-
tion that Lord Howick's letter (a copy of which forms the bulk of YW
own) substantiates a part of your former statement, which I hacl
flatly
denied. Your words are "that part of my statement with respect to
Lord H. which you so flatly deny."
Now this shows to what a pitch of blindness and misrepresentation
respectable man may be carried by the influence of excited party ,°"
personal feelings—perhaps still further ruffled by a sense of his °"'n
conduct not having been quite what it ought to have been. It is utterly
and notoriously untrue that I ever "flatly denied" your statement, or
in any way " denied" it, or said any one word which could be construed
into any thing like a " denial" by any person who could read what I
had
written with calm attention. The following, strange to say, are the ex-
pressions which the excited state of your feelings hare induced Y°tl t°
represent as a "flat denial:"—
" As for Lord H. leaving the Colonial-office, I conceive you must ha'
been mistaken ; for," &c.

" The fact I hal always supposed to he quite certain," &c.
Now, when you coolly read this you will at once perceive that IsP°lt
entirely upon probabilities, and used every precaution which the IP'
guage afflnnied roe, to chew that I did Nor flatly deny, or in any ‘4'3/

deny, your statement.
It appears by Lord IL's letter, that he wrote to me upon the stlt)PCt
of the arrangement in the Emancipation Bill, and never received any
answer. The probability is that I did not read his letter, which may
appear the less unlikely, and perhaps the less inexcusable, when I add
that at the very time in question one of my Secretaries, who
is still in
oflice under the present Government, in answer to a question put in
Committee of the House of Lords as to the number of letters daily .re-
ceived by me, swore that the number that day was PS. I think TuY
respect fur Lord H. would have prevented me from allowing any
letter
of his to pass unanswered, had not the pressure of business prevented

me from reading it.
His Lordship refers to what passed in the House of Commons, h°l
never till this moment had heard or seen a word of it. In consequence
of his letter I have read the debates. I find his statement born,
out by the fact, and I nate know the reason of his ec'
signing. You will 'perhaps admit, that bad I been aware of tile
fact, I never could have taken the preposterous trouble of alluingi.
the other way upon the pro3ability, as in ignorance of the fact I di
when I last wrote to you.
The perusal of the debates has further sliewn me, and it is
some consolation, that if we of Lord Grey's Cabinet were all in the wrong'
and all equally so, upon the necessity of apprenticeship, and have °°l3'
been undeceived by the experience of the last four years ; and if Lord
Howick is now found to have been right upon this point, even .
is subject to the common lot of humanity, and is liable ta,
err like the rest of 'us upon another important questie'
when we erring mortals of the Grey Cabinet were ht
for he, I perceive, is represented as always contending that the n—araire
would not work as an indentured apprentice, and that it would bo
to place tins in the intermediate state, while we of ttie Cabinet T'c'-
doubted both his working and his peaceful demeanour under the 3PI-t
lice system. How far he will continue so after the Ist of ALlFost'nte.er
°I
is quite another question. I still trust to his peaceful disposifien' h
more than doubt his continuing to work. be.n
That I thought six years too lung a peeled and wished it to Istthe
1. of
made four, which would have made apprenticeship cease en the fro
next August, you will find plainly enough intimated by what 'll
me in the House of Lords on 11, ednesday, August 14, 103. taint
And now let me beg of yoU to bear with me if I make n° c°l".rient.

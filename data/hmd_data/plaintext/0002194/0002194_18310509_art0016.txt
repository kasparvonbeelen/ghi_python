IKEY SOLOMON.

The Papers have fallen into a great mistake in report-
ing the decision of the Judges in the matter of the above
notorious individual by stating that their Lordship's had
come to the conclusion, that he was guilty as a principal,
and that sentence of death would therefore be passed upon
him, than which nothing could be more erroneous; the
real facts are briefly these
In September last, Solomon was charged and tried upon
eight several indictments, seven of which were laid calm-
tally, and one was for a minor offence; he was tried upon
three and acquitted, the jury not finding him a principals
Upon the other four he was subsequently tried in the New
Court, but the capital part of the charge was abandoned;
he was only indicted as a guilty receiver. He was also
convicted upon the charge of simple larceny, which alone
only subjects him to seven years' transportation. An ob-
jection was taken at the time to the legality of these coo-
victions upon the point, that the theft took place before
the passing of Mr. Peel's act, when a receiver could not
be convicted without the principal.
On the other hand, it was contended that recent pos-
session of the stolen property was enough to bring the case
within the meaning of the statute.
The Recorder was of the haar opinion, but the point
being a novel one and involving an important question, be
reserved it, and this indeed was the only matter upoa
which the Judges had to deliberate, and not as has bee!
stated, to enquire whether he was a " principal." Their
Lordships were of opinion that the conviction was right,
as to the " felonious reception."
The prisoner will be brought up for judgment nett
week, and he is liable to 21 years' banishment, which at
his age is tantamount to transportation for life.
The convict, whose conduct in Newgate has been most
exemplary, is extremely desirous to join his wife and familP
who are settled at Van Diemen's Land, the sons having
en the arrival of Mrs. Solomon as a convict about tvr°
years agn received her from the Governor of the cola,'
as their female servant, an l thus by a deep laid scheme the,'
deprived slavery of its sting.

One of the weekly Papers maintains that the
electors of Cambridge " come from no particular class, and
are of no particular professions." An examination of the
poll-book will soon dissipate this error if it he an honeS
one. The numbers subjoined are not given as altogether
accurate, but may he relied on within a few, and shore,,
pretty plainly in what " particular class and professions

Rear-Admiral and Lady OWEN were at Pe'
nang on the 12th of October last. The pirates in the
Straits had become exceedingly bold. An English sloop'
in passing down, had been attacked, and every one 011
board murdered ; among them a young Bengal officer,
cruising about for his health. Early in October they at'
tacked two China junks, within sight of Penang, PluT
dered them, and set fire to ships, crew, and all. Six p.'
ratical boats sailed right through the harbour, almost under
the stern of the Southampton, and afterwards sent a mesa'
sage of defiance to the Admiral. The ships' boats ha
been out after them, but without success, and the South'
ampton was cruising in the Straits. It is like sending atl
elephant after a musquito : they have a perfect knowledS,e
of all the creeks on the coast, and always elude the vigl;
lance even of British seamen. Lord and Lady DALitousi
had left Penang for Calcutta.—Hampshire Telegraph.

The scene in the Upper House, on the dissolution of Pa::
!lament, is described with great force and humour. .""
the middle is a column dedicated to the KING and CO
stitution ; Lord J. RUSSELL is placed on the top
mirror of truth in his hand. A furious group, in whit
the Duke of WELLINGTON, Sir R. PEEL, Lords Elx°',
and ELLENBOROUGH, are conspicuous, are exerting their,'
selves with fruitless ensrgy, both by ropes and saes, to
move the column from its case. On the other side, Lord°
GREY, BROUGHAM, and others, stand calmly and firm
contemplating the absurd and useless violence of theil
opponents. As a finish, a scene of rural and commerci,
proserity is introduced as the result of the great improve'
m, ne of oar political institutions by the downfall of cos
ruption, with Oh.

ing has been fulfilled, deserve on your part, More
payticalimly, 0, 1-Nimans !,a splendbl and magni-
ficent Monumcht, which may live for ever,, pre-
sei ye foi posterity the me riuity of such joyful and
happy events, in the same manner as your immor-
tal ancestors, to eternize the memory of their
glorious victories over barbarons nations, raised the
splendid monuments which still enrich and adorn
the capital of the Christian world; The Nobility,
Gentry., and'inhabitants of the Roman States, as
welLas, Great. Britain, France, Spain,
,Germany,
Rossia,Portug..l,and all the Other nations olEu rope,
atimadverted wit ii the saute Seotiment and the sante
interest, are invited to promote this noble tinder-
taking in the metropolis of the_ChriStiao world'. The
. Monument consist of a ina-r,nifieent and lofty
pyramid, upon the summit Of which be placed
the statue of trintliphant Religion., The pyramid
wit rest upon a-robtist and solid.base, composed
of large blocks of marble, in allusion, to the
,Sta-
bility of the -Catholic Wligion, and to the con- '
staney and firmness of tits August Sovereigns who'
have so gloriously co-operated to deliver s: t 1 cteti
Europe front the Slavery under which it groaned.
On the principal front of the Monument will lie
placed the semblance of the Sovereign Pontilf.
:the Seventh.; on the tWo other sides those of the
Sovereigns who have formed the iininortal coali-
tion ; on the fourth %vitt be`reprjsented those dis-
tinguished persons who, by their counsels and
artus,have contributed in a special manner to the
result:of the most just and noble cause. -More-
over-, if the funds produced by the subscription
Should suffice, there shall be erected roUnd the pe-
destal, the Statues of the Sovereign Pontiff, of the
All ed Sovereigns, and of the most celebrated and
distinguil.hed Heroes. In the interior of the Mo-
nument will be
.placed the busts and the names of
those Illustrious AVarriors %vitt') particularly sig-
nalized themselves in battle, or who fell victims in
the field of glory in defence-of the common cause
of Liberty. •
t` The first Artists of every Nation are invited
to shake drawingS of the Monument according to
the plan mentioned, or any other form they may
conceive better calculated for the object, as the
idea proposed is-a compound style of architecture,
which has originated from-the object being intend-
ed to immortalize those, great characters that at
present exist, and as a monument to thos'e who
have 1;allen a sacrafit:e in this glorious struggle;
but of whiCh compound architecture there is no
, ancient example. Eleven ,persons-aniong.the Sub-
scribers, who may be deemed the, most versed in
the fine arts, comprising Mr. Eagan, Consul-Ge-
neral of his British Majesty for Sicily and Malta,
as artist, shall choose the_ be“ of
,three' drawings,
and propose a spacious and frequented situation,
on which, with the approbation of his .Holiness,
it may be considered proper to erect the Monti.-
ment, and shall supeeinteotl the exaotcoMpletion
'of the same; The history of such great -and cotta7
plicated events, engraved on bronze and deposit.;
ed in this Monument, will hand down to posterity
and to Inture ages, the epoit of recovered liberty,
which seemed condemned to the tyrant yoke of
slavery,' destructive of morMity and social virtues.

Num:s.--`• The solid and rufna.,:t base will serve to give to
future ageslthe idea of the 'events Which hire happenetl ; as
these events have occasioned the death of so inany Valiant
Heroes who foiiiht and fell for liberty, so no plan can be
wore adapted- fora lasting Matisolem to eternize their
mory, than this solid base. The Kramitheal forru has been
chosen fur two reasons—in the first. placi , becuu c I

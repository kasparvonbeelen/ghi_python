HE,LIGOLA,ND Aid! L.

FTELIOOLANiI, MARCH 28.—We learn from pas-
sengers that the Danish or Norwegan seamen, iron)
some new arrangements heti, een Ressia nail Den-
mark, or from a misunderstanding v‘ lib their con-
duaors,, had aanally stopped on their march to Ant.
Werp, and that even some part of. the last division
had recrossed the Elbe.,: Nothing further respeaing
the Russian war.

Fla LIGOLAN a, MA rtca 22.—The refrgtory spi-
rit manifested by the Hambuigh 'city guard, on be-
ing ordered to assume the French cockade, appears
to have been of a' more serious nature than was at
first supposed, and had not the most prompt and
energetic measures been adopted to suppie,s it,
might have led to a very general ferinent.--They
had threatened the, house of the Freud) Comman-
dint and luid thualty taken possession of the,gate of
the town, before a sag:He'll munbet'of Ftench troops
assembled and forced them to dvsist. They were
afierwards marched out of tho town, End 150 of
them who cOntinokl to shew a ‘liiposition for mu.
tiny, were brought ,back, chained together, two by,
two, ihtis exhibiting to time inhabitants of this once
free and proSperans city, the most melancholy proofs
Of the degradation and slavery into which they have
sunk. Notwithstanding their. fetters, they are said
to have re-entered the city with shouts a Long
live the King of England." lint of:them will, no
doubt, be idiot.. !Con of the guards, in crossing from
ttimborgh to Harborgh, threw themselves into the
river. and were drowned,

The hpirit of the. Hamborghers appears complete-
ly broken, and despir and consternation are every
where visible.

'Several have put an end to 'their existence, and
the final eztindion or their itniortance as.a State is
fir:eci. .The diSposition to emigrate is general, and
otrie individiLtli nave already withdrawn. to. Russia.
The funds of the Senate and Admiralty have been
appointed by the new',GOvernment, and the Bank,
though, according to the iategt accounts, still re-
speMatl, is 'considered in a very precariou3 state.
The conscription in the:towns lately incorpo-
rated, is considyred as a most grievous measure.
Thirty of the young men liable to be drawn, fled
over to this Islaml on the iatli instant, to avu!d
•
being 3eitt to the army.

There have been instances of wives haring maim-
ed their Husbands, by cutting off their hands to
Avoid being drawn, so strong is the atersion to the

meagore.

War between Russia and France is still talked of
its unavoidable. The troops of both parties are said
to 'he'on their march to the frontiers. The French
Governlotto have interdiaed the granting ,ot pass.
ports to Russia.

Sweden has been called upon to (tarnish p...!,000
Men for the French marine, and I o,mR) land
troops ; part of the seamen have already marched
through Hamburg!), and it is Said have manifest-
ed the greatest discontent. The land forces . have
been refused; the King of Sweden alleging they
were necessary for the defence of the country,
against any attempt that might be made by the
Logh,.ll.

A NEW EDITION, WITH IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL
REMARKS AND CASES.
Just published, the 19th Edition, price 4s.
AN HISTORICAL and PRACTICAL
TREATISE on SYPHILIS, its Consequences, on Stria-
tures, Eruptions, Nodes, and Nocturnal Pains, so frequently mis-
taken for Rheumatism. These subjects are illustrated by a variety
of highly interesting cases, together with the miseries of a secret
vice, so long and so unhappily pursued by the youth of both sexes.
In the one it will be found an unfailing source of barrenness, in
the other have its ravages fatally developed by a distressing state
of debility which, if not timely remedied, terminates in impotency ;
these are its remote and ultimate effects ; whilst Consumption,
Loss of Muscular Power, and various other complaints, usually
characterise the earlier stages of these distressing diseases, for the
Cure of which the Author has laid down a plan of treatment which,
during his experience of upwards of thirty-five years' extensive
practice, has invariably proved successful ; with concluding remarks
on the evils resulting from attempts at self cure.

FOUNDLINGS.—The number of these poor deserted
human beings has increased of late so much in France that the
Government has been under the necessity of adopting some
new arrangements respecting them. One suggestion which
has been made—that of sending the children away from
the place where they have been left to another, has succeeded
in awakening some parental feelings in those who exposed
them, for in the district of Gers alone, upon this threat
being held out, no less than 600 unnatural parents came for-
ward to claim their offspring, lest, by the change, they should
lose sight of them altogether.

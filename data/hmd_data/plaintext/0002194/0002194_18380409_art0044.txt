Such is a part of the scheme now in progress4under the
eXpfess sanction of our religious government, to defraud
the West lonia appientieeS Of their labour, and to kidnap
a race of men, in a rude state of simple natufZ,:; an4'ho,
there is every reason to believe, are deluded in their en-
,Tagements, and exposed to treatur nt of the harshest kind.
Intlad thiit, fact is entablished by
~a paper laid by Mr. Scott,
of the Bengal civil service, before Lord Auckland, the
Governal General of India, in which we find the following
paragraph :
,‘ With very rare exceptions, I doubt if there are many who
congratulate themselves on the bargain they have made ; they
stated they had HI Calcutta under the impression that they
were going to the Company's Ra Bustie (company's village)
the name by which the Mauritius is designated by the agents in
India ; how far the term was complimentary or compulsory I
cannot say ; and while I make no charge of misrepresentation,
I am bound to acknowledge the difficulty of correctly and in-
telligibly describing an island in the Indian Ocean to a person
who had never seen the sea, or knew what an island was."
And is the cheat practised upon these harmless crea-
tures, softened by their subsequent treatment ? Listen to
the measured exposure set forth in the following important
letter from the Colonial Secretary of the Mauritius to the
Chief Secretary of Bengal :
" Port Louis, 22d April, 1837.

" Sir—His Excellency Si; William Nicolay directs me
again to draw the attention of the Supreme government to the
subject of the Indian labourers emigrating to this colony► and
to point out to his Lordship in Council the urgency of some
measures being adopted, with a view to these people being
properly treated on the passage to the Maurit►us. By the
accompanying documents, you will see that three successive
ships have been placed in quarantine, owing to the disease and
extensive mortality that has prevailed among the labourers
embarked upon them. In the William Wilson thirty-one men
died, in the Indian Oak six, and in the Adelaide twenty-four,
out of seventy-two, died before her arrival here, and two have
died since. 'The William Wilson had 224 labourers, and the
Indian Oak 200, each baying a large cargo of rice, and so
had the Adelaide. It is impossible, therefore, that the Indians
could have had proper accommodation or the means of that
protection from the weather, which on such a voyage ought to
have been reserved for them. What their treatment per-
sonally has been on board it is difficult to say; but there was
no medical officer, nor any person to attend to their welfare or to
see them duly cared for."
Such is an outline of the dupery which has been prac-
tised upon the British nation, from whom twenty millions
of sterling money have been wrung, for the extinction of a
system of slavery, which is now working with aggravated
severity—and such is the new slave trade, now in full
progress under the auspices of the British Government,
fostered by British capital, and carried on by British mer-
chants, boasting of their humanity and Christian principles.
Never was a fouler stain cast upon the British name, nor
deeper reproach upon all who are concerned in or connive
at it. It must be put down.—Weekly True Sun.

ELECTION COMMITTEES.

(SATURDAY.)

(From our Second Edition of Saturday.)
HULL.
Wm. Bayles, sen. Wm. Bayles, jun., Aaron Johnson,
John Willingham, William Burton, jun. and William Burton,
sen., all of Barton, were struck off, on the ground of having
been treated. The evidence was the same as in the cases be-
fore disposed of.
Mr. HILL proposed to strike off the name of Richard Catt-
ley, who was objected to as having given a bribe.
The Counsel for the sitting Members then applied to the
Committee, to know on what ground Mr. Burton, sen., had
been struck off, he having been objected to as having given a
bribe, and also as having received ono.
The room was cleared. On our re-admission, the CHAIR-
MAN 'aid, although it was not the opinion of the Committee
that cases might not arise in which it would he convenient
that the Committee should state the grounds of their decision,
it wa4 their opinion that, as a general practice, it was extremely
inconvenient, and in this Committee had already been carried
too far, by which much cavilling and delay had been caused.
The Committee had a strong authority for acting in this way,
seeing that, on the Evesham Committee, of which Sir R.
Peel was Chairman, a similar request having been made to
him, he positively declined giving the reasons on which the
Committee had acted. After considering the present appli-
cation, the Committee declined giving any reasons for their
decision.

The Committee then adjourned at three o'clock until Mon-
day morning at ten.
The total number of rotes struck from the poll of the sitting
Members at the rising of the Committee is 31, leaving Mr.
Hutt (one of the petitioners) in a majority of 33 over Mr.
Wilberforce, and the other petitioner (Mr. Wood), about 26
below Sir Walter James.

KINSALE.
The Committee retained the ♦ote of James Weekes.
John Farley was next objected to, on the ground of insufl'i,
clout value. The case bad not been decided when the Com
mittec adjourned, at three o'clock.
The petitioner is still in a majority of one.

The Senate of the London University held a board
on Wednesday last for the election of a registrar and secre-
tary, a situation for which there were, we understand, no
fewer than 94 candidates. After a close examination of the
mass of testimonials sent in, a preliminary ballot took place,
each member selecting five names to be placed upon a re.
duced list, from which a decisive ballot is eventually to be
made. The names of the successful candidates on this ballot
were--Professor Daniels, Mr. Graves, Mr. Roney, Mr. Laing,
Mr. Rothman, Mr. Wedgwood, Mr. Atkinson, and Mr.
Thompson.

ANECDOTE OF BYRON.—" I was," says Sir W.
Knighton, " Lord Byron's medical attendant for some time
previously to his marriage. One morning, on making him
my accustomed visit, I found the table at• which he was
writing covered with printers' proof sheets, scraps of manu-
script verses, &c. On my being announced he neither raised
his head nor the pencil from the paper he was rapidly scrib-
bling, but said, ' Be so kind as to take a book, and be silent
for two minutes.' A longer time had scarcely elapsed when
he threw down the pencil with an air of satisfaction,
I have done it at last.' He apologised for claiming a
poet's indulgence, saying that the last four lines of that
stanza had given him more trouble than the whole poem be-
sides, adding, The right words came into my head just as
your carriage drove up. His Lordship then rose, and, with a
said abruptly, ' Knighton, what do you think I am going
to do? lam going to marry.' I replied, lam sorry to hear
it, my Lord.' The d--1 you arc l And why should I not ?'
Because I do not think you are constituted to be happy in a
married life.' lie looked grave, and, after a pause, said, I
believe you are right, but the ladies think otherwise (alluding
to his sister, Mrs. L.) However, the die is cast ; for I have
presented myself in due form to the lady's papa. I had an
amicable reception. The only personal question put to me
was, when I was mounting my horse, Sir Ralph called after
me, ' Pray, my Lord, how do you pronounce your name ?
Birron, or Byron ?' I replied, BY, Sir, spells by all this
world over.' "—Memoirs (f Sir W. Knighton.
We understand that inquiries, recently prosecuted at
the instance of the proper department of the Government,
have led to the discovery of a fact of great importance to the
public health of the metropolis. It appears that complaints
made by persons living in the neighbourhood, of the state of
the water in the pump at Charing-cross, near the statue,
caused an application to Nit-. Brande, Professor of Chemistry
to the Royal Institution, that he should ascertain whether these
complaints were well-founded. We hear that the result of
Mr. Brande's analysis has been to convince him that the water
is at present so contaminated by oozings from the gas-pipes as
to be totally unfit for use ; that it is neither fit for drinking,
nor for any ordinary culinary purposes ; but, what is of more
general importance, Mr. Braude states that the contamination
of toe springs by gas is an evil rapidly extending itself in other
parts of the metropolis.—Observer.

A MADAGASCAR INVITATION.--A corres-
pondent of the Mauricien writes from Tamatave, Madagascar,
27th October. an account of the return of the Deputies of her
Majesty the Queen of that island, from the Courts of Eng-
land and France, after a year's absence, and from one of whom
he received an invitation to dinner, which he copies literally
as beneath, and which we extract as a morceau not a little
curious :—" Tamatave, the 21st day of the moon, 1837.
M. M This is what I have to tell you : that to-morrow
afternoon when the watch says four, I call on you to eat at
Government House. Live, enjoy good health, and good bye.
I (Signed) Andriantsitophaina 11th Honor (of other officers.")
—Parbury's Oriental Herald.
Thirty-nine gentlemen have received the diploma of
the London College of Surgeons in the past month.
There is at present residing at the foot of Brediland-
road, near the West Toll of Paisley, a woman, whose singular
case and state of body is well calculated to excite surprise.
Her name is Jane Hamilton. She is at present about 37 years
of age, and has been so affected with disease in the head for
the last 19 years of her life as to have been the greater part of
that time confined to bed, and the whole of it incapable of
earning anything for her support. She was at first seized with
apoplexy, and during 11 years of the 19 referred to, she was
deprived of her speech. About the latter end of August she
felt so affected with an oppressive heat in her forehead, and an
inclination to be in the open air, that she commenced the prac-
tice of bathing her head and breast every morning in a burn
which runs past the garden foot of her residence. After bath
ing she regularly sat down at the garden foot, and continue.'
in the same position till the 10 o'clock bell. The most re-
markable circumstance connected with this case is the strength
of constitution and habit which has enabled this singular wo-
man to remain exposed to all the rigour of the late inclement
season, and that, too, sitting on the cold snow or ground for
whole days, with the atmosphere in a state of temperature
which the most robust and best protected could scarcely resist
for one hour. She is but poorly protected with clothing, and
as poorly supplied with food. The place where she sits is at
the back of a low hedge, with nothing but the ground beneath
her, and the clouds above.—Glasynw Chronicle.
The idea of crossing the Atlantic by steam is by
no means new. Fitch, the original inventor of steam naviga-
tion, boldly predicted in 1790 the early navigation of the At-
lantic by steam ; and about twenty years since a steam.vessel
actually arrived at Liveppool direct from a Port in the 1 tpited

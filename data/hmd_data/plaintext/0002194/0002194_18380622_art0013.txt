move its second reading on Monday se'enight.
CHURCH OF SCOTLAND.
Earl FITZ WIL LIA M presented several petitions against
any farther grants to the Scotch Church. The Noble Earl
said he had some petitions on the subject of Negro
slavery, which, under present circumstances, he should with-
draw. One of the petitions, with regard to Scotch Church
Endowments, contained the word " diabolical," as applied to
Legislative measures.
Lord LONDONDERRY objected that the petition could
not be received.
Earl FIT ZWILLIAM said, undoubtedly he should not like
to use such language, but he did not know if it were unparliamen-
tary. —( Loud laughter.) Besides, the petition only referred
to measures as diabolical which were now repealed.—( Hear,
hear. )_Ordered to lie on the table.

TITHES.

Mr. PARROTT gave notice, that he should, on the 15th
of March, call the attention of the House to the causes pre-
venting the voluntary commutation of tithes. The lion.
Member also moved for the copies of several Returns with re-
spect to Tithes.
Mr. GROTE presented a petition from !, Parish in Wilt-
shire, and another from Fife, in favour of Void by 13allot ;
also a petition from a congregation in Devonshire,
Negro Apprenticeship system.
SPANISH LEGION. aoinst the

Sir H. HARDINGE seeing the Noble Lord, the Secre-
tary for th rofeigti pep:tit:lent, in his place, wished to ask
him a question. About two months ago he had asked when
the remnant of the legion might be expected home, and he was
then told that vessels would bo sent out for that purpose
immediately. Ho was now informed that they were et pre-
sent kept at St. Sebastian in a state of the greatest misery
and destitution, many of them being without trowsers—scarcely
any of them having shoes, and be was informed upon good au-
thority that a sergeant had been found dead in consequence
of the inclemency of the weather and the want of clothing.
He mentioned these things—he was confident that the Noble
Lord would take every step in his power to relieve the suffer-
ings of the pcor men. He had further seen it stated in
the public newspapers, that an officer had been sent by the
Suanish Grlyeriment, with a sum of money amongst these

men—which was to be distributed amongst them for the pur-
pose of trepanning them to enlist into a new Legion which
W7S about to be raised. That was an infamous course
of proceeding, to which he was sure the Noble Lord
would not be a party. lie trusted that the Noble Lord would
bring them over as soon as possible.
Lord PALMERSTON said, some time ago it had been
stated to the Government that there was a great number who
had formed the Legion who were anxious to return ; and
accordingly a frigate and a transport were sent out for them,
having on board a quantity of clothing, in case any of them
should be in a state of destitution. They remained there some
dap, but the frigate being wanted for other purposes
was ordered away. The transport, however, remained ready
to bring home any of those %clic) were anxious and willing to do
so—they had not accepted of the offer, and he presumed they
did not like to come away until some settlement had been made
by the Spanish Government. He was informed by Sir George
Villiers that the Spanish Government had sent an officer
with a certain sum of money amongst these men,
and that it was the intention of the Spanish Government to
re-orear.ise a portion of the Legion. Lord John Hey had
assured the Admiralty, that he considered himself as hav-
ing the charge of these men, and that he would see that every
one of them had his own perfect free will either to accept or
to reject the offers of the officer in question.—( Hear, hear.)
lie (Lord P.) had the fullest confidence in Lord John Hay,
and whether those men came borne or remained, he was quite
certain that the Act would be one of their own spontaneous
free will.
Sir G. DE LACY EVANS said, the Right lion. Gen-
tleman opposite had said he had the greatest possible con-
fidence in Lord John Hay. So had he (Sir G. E.), but the
Right Honourable Baronet had not evinced that confidence
by the ardent feeling he had displayed in that House.—
(Hear.) He knew as well as the Right Honourable Bart.
what the character of Lord John Flay was, and a good deal
better, for ho had had reason to know him better.—(Great
aughter and cheering from the Opposition Benches.) He
ad derived his knowledge from the same source as the
ight Honourable Baronet.—(Cheers from the Ministerial-
sts.) It was rather uncourteous for the Right Honourable
Baronet to refer to the name of Lord John Hay,
:without reflecting it was possible that he ( Sir G. Evans) was
in communication with that Noble Lord.—(Cries of " Oh,
h," from the Opposition.) The Right lion. Baronet
'had said the Legion were in a state of degradation
and starvation, but he asserted there was no such
:thing as starvation among them.--( Renewed cries of " Oh.")
He would further state, that although these men had a right
to demand permission to return to England in consequence of
the non-fulfilment of engagements towards them, he:had reason
to state on the same authority, they were not in a worse state
than the troops were under his own command.—(Great
laughter and cheers on the Opposition benches—he should like
to know whether the conclusion of the sentence would elicit
cheers from Gentlemen on the opposite side—and that those
troops were not in a worse condition than the Peninsular
army was at different periods.—(Loud cries of " Oh, oh,"
from the Opposition, and Cheers from the Ministerial side).

Sir IL:HARDING E-1 shall never, during the exercise of
my Parliamentary duty, think it necessary to regulate my con-
duct by the opinions of the Gallant Officer opposite.—(Loud
cheers.) I beg to remind him, and I beg to remind the
House, that their late Commander, Brigadier-General
O'Connell, has declared in his official order of the day
that the conduct of the Spanish Government towards the
Legion was most infamous. When the Honourable and
Gallant 0 dicer rises to vindicate—l say to vindicate —the
treatment of the Spanish Government, and to state that un-
fortunate individuals are not suffering from want, I assert, not
only from information I have received, but also from the public
documents of their officers, and more especially of Brigadier
General O'Connell, that their treatment has been of the moat
infamous description..—( Loud cheering from the Tories.)
The SPEAKER said that it was not with his concurrence
that any observations had been made, after the Noble Lord,
the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, had answered the question
put to him ; and he had now only to appeal to Hon. Members
themselves, that the conversation should cease.—(Loud cries
of ,' Hear, hear," from the Ministerial benches.)
Sir G. D. EVANS arose amidst much cheering and cries
of " Order," " Chair." He was understood to say that he
bowed to the decision of the chair.
Sir A. DA L RYMPL E made some observations which
were not heard in the gallery, in consequence of the confusion
in the House.
Lord J. RUSSELL rose to order. He thought that after
the decision of the Speaker, the House ought not to allow the
conversation to be carried further.—(Cheers.)
SIR G. D. EVANS'S KNIGHTHOOD.

An Hon. MEMBER, whose name we could not learn,
thought the present a fitting opportunity to ask of the
Noble Lord who last addressed the House, whether the
appointment of Sir G. De Lacy Evans to the rank of Knight
Commander of the Bath had been made in the usual manner
—that is, whether it had passed through the War-office, and
on the recommendation of the Commander-in- Chief ?—( Vehe-
ment cheering frora the Tory benches, responded to by the
Reformers.)
' Lord I'ALMERSTON said—My answer is, that the ap-
pointment of the Hon. and Gallant Gentleman alluded to, to
be a commander of the Order of the Bath, was made in
the usual manner by her Majesty's Government, and that the
appointment was made on our own responsibility.—(Great
cheering.) The Hon. and Gallant Gentleman is mistaken,
in supposing that it is at all necessary, or that it has ever
been the invariable practice, that the exercise of the dis-
cretion of the Government, in recommending to the Crown
for the honour of Knight Commander of the Bath, should
be used through the authority of the person alluded to.
With regard to myself, I think that the honour was well be-
stowed and well earned.—( Extraordinary cheering.)
The same Hon. MIUDER again rose, and made some ob-
servations (which were not heard) amidst considerable inter-
ruption.
Lord JOHN RUSSELL rose to order. The Hon.
Member had put a question, and received an answer, and with
that he ought to be satisfied.
Sir A. DALRYMPLE said, that as the House had heard
the answer, he wished to ask whether Sir G. Evans was one
of the ten foreign officers (as we understood) who were en-
titled to the rank.—(Loud cheers, and cries of " Oh, oh,"
from the Ministerial benches.)
Sir G. D. E VANS, who was for some time interrupted
by cheers and counter-cheers, said—As this is made a per-
sonal question—( Renewed cheers)—l think myself entitled to
ask whether the Hon. Member has the authority of the Noble
Lord at the head of the Army for making the inquiry ?
The Hon. Member (whom we believe to be Mr. B RAD-
S!' AW) said—l have Rot—( Loud cheers)—but I speak upon
the part of those officers of the army who consider themselves
unjustly passed over.—( Loud and continued cheering. )
RUSSIA.

_ Mr. MACLEAN enquired of the for the Foreign
Department, if, subsequently to the correspondence which had
been laid on the table relative to the Vixen, other corres-
pondence had taken place between himself and Mr. Bell, and
if he would have any objection to lay it before the House ? Also,
whether the Noble Lord had received any account from the
authorities at Constanstinople of an outrage alleged to have
been committed by a Russian brig of war upon a British
inercLantinan in the Dardanelles, by twice firing at her?
Lord PALMERSTON said that he should have no objec-
tion to produce the papers referred to. As to the other
transaction, he had received, a few days ago, an ac-
count stating that two English merchant vessels were lay-
ing at anchor in the Dardanelles, and that a Russian brig
of war, passing up or down, fired at one, to show her colours,
which she did, and then fired at the other to show her colours,
which she also did. And he (Lord P.) understood it to be
the invariable practice at sea, that when a ship of war meets a
merchant vessel with no colours up, the ship of war first in-
vites her to show her colours by allowing her own, and then,
in case of a refusal, fires at her.
In reply to another question from Mr. MLcLeAN, the Noble
Lord said, that he could distinctly state that the shots which
were fired were blank.
Mr. O'CONNELL.
Lord MAIDSTONE rose and said—Seeing the Honour-
able and Learned Member for Dublin in his place,
I wish to ask him whether some sentiments which I
see reported to have been used by him in a speech delivered
at a dinner which took place at the Crown and Anchor
Tavern, in the Strand, on Wednesday, the 21st instant, and
which was presided over by Colonel De Lacy Evans, are sub-
stantially correct? I will read these statements to the House, and
I hope the Hon. and Learned Member will do ma the favour of
stating whether they are correct or not. I take them from
om
the _Morning Chronicle—the words are these :—" Corrup-
tion of the worst description existed, and, above all,
there
was the perjury of the Tory politicians.—(Groans.) Ire-
land was not safe (cora the English and Scotch gentry. It
was horrible to think that a body of gentlemen—men who
ranked high in society, who were themselves the adminis-
trators of the law, and who ought therefore to be above all
suspicion, and who ought to set an example to others—was
it not horrible that they should be perjuring themselves
in the Committees of the flouse of Commons. The time
was come when this should be proclaimed boldly. lie
was ready to be a martyr to justice and truth, but not to
false swearing; and, therefore, he repeated that there was
foal perjury In the Tory Committees of the House of Com-
mons. I find another passage in the Morning Po.sf,
and which is not in the Chronicle in which the lien.
Member declares "he will not mince the matter." When I
sir/ these sentiments reported, I said to myself that it would
be but fair towards the Hon. and Learned Gentleman to in-
quire if they were correct ; and if not, to give him an op •
portunity of contradicting them.—(llear, hear, hear. )
because I do say that the words themselves contain asper-
sions upon Members belonging to this House—( Cheers from
the Opposition,)—which I for one should wish to see wiped
away at the earliest opportunity possible.—( Cheers.) Now,
Sir, I ask the Learned Member to give a plain answer to the
• -*ion I have put to him, for I cannot go on further till that

every word of that--(Cheb:a •and cries of " Oh")—every
word of that—and Ido repeat ti.,:et I believe it to be perfectly
true.—( Loud cries of " 06, oh.") Is there a man that will
put hii hand to his heart and say, upon his honour
test that is sub-
as a gentleman, that he does not believe t~ use
stantially true.—( No, no.) It is a hideous T Tande
puilic press has taunted you with it. Tho last tim, f

the Morning Chronicle ---

The SPEAKER—I wish to make a remark as to the
regularity of our proceedings. The Honourable and Learned
Member havit:g answered the question, I must now appeal to
the Noble Lord to know what motion he intends to make.—
( Cheers, and loud cries of " Move.")
Lord MAIDSTONE, after some delay, arising from
his having to consult with the friends around him, in conse-
quence of his being unprepared what to course adopt, said--Sir,
in consequence of the Learned Member for Dublin having
owned that he has said exactly what is sta'ed—ia
short, having allowed that my statement is sub,tan-
tislly true—l give notice of a motion to bring his
conduct before the House on Monday next.—(Opposition
cheers.) For Ido think that such an aspersion ought not to
have been made without proof being adduced. I give notice
for next Monday, to bring before the House the conduct of the
Learned Member for Dublin.—(Opposition cheers.)
Lord J. RUSSELL—Sir, I beg to give notice, that if that
motion is entertained, I mean to bring before the considera-
tion of the House the charge made by the Right Rev. Prolate,
the Bi.hop of Exeter, respecting an allegation of perjury
against certain Members of this House.—( Vehement and
long-continued cheering from the Mini,terial Benches.)
Mr. Sergeant JACK SON addressed some observations to
the House, which was quite itiaudib!e in the confusion that
prevailed.

POOR-LA WS—(IRELAND).
The Order of the Day for the House going into Committee
on the Poor-laws Ireland Bill having been read,
Mr. O'CONNELL Legged to remind the Right Hon.
Gentleman, the Member for Rippon, of his remark, that all
Ireland wanted was peace, and to ask him what social element
of discord would be removed if the Bill passed.
The House then went into Committee on the Poor-laws
(Ireland) Bill, Mr. BERNAL in the Chair.
On clause 36 being read,
Mr. F. SHAW, as we understood, objected to the clause.
After a few words from the ATTORNEY-GENERAL, and Mr.
O'CoNeeee, clause 87 wns agreed to.
Clauses 38 and 39 were agreed to without amendment.
Clause 40 was agreed to with a verbal amendment.
On clause 41 being read, which empowered Guardians to
grant relief to the poor in wsrkhouses,
Mr. LUCAS moved an amendment to the effect, that
the relief should be " at the cost of the districts wherein
they may have respectively acquired a settlement."
The Honourable Member then proceeded to point out the
advantages which would result from the amendment he
proposed. It would prevent the rates being swallowed up
by those who might be casually poor in the district, to the
detriment of the poor who really had a right to the relief.
He would not ask whether, under the Bill, there would be a
right to enquire into the question whether the person applying
for relief had or had not relations capable of supporting him.
He objected altogether to the fixing of a right of settlement in a
particular district. If the law of England was transferred to
Ireland, the chance of losses would be diminished one hun-
dred fold. He wished to know if they proposed to make any
inquiry into the character of those wko entered a district to
claim relief; whether they had friends elsewhere, or relations
capable of supporting them ; or whether they were persons
flying from justice ? The litigation in English parishes was
lamentable to the paupers and burthensome to the parish ;
but the chance of litigation would be much diminished in Ire-
land by the smallness of the relief granted and the increased
site of the Unions. In England 4s. 6d. was the average sum
granted per week to a single pauper, while in Ireland it would
oily be about Is. 6d. per man ;_ and an Irish Union would ex-
tend, on an average, over 103 English parishes, so that the
evils of litigation would be lessened one-third in this latter
respect alone. They had another way of diminishing the ex-
penses of law suits—bee adopting the arrangements of the Act
which established Savings' Banks in Ireland, wherein the
duty on stamps in all legal proceedings was remitted, and the
expensive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery was got rid
of altogether. As to the settleraent by consent or convention
he looked upon it as altogether visionary. The Hoe. Gentle-
man then adverted to the subject of emigration, and quoted
from the Reports recomnaeading the system for Ireland a
statement of the advantages to be derived by landlords in the
clearance of paupers from their estates; but the chief advan-
tage would altogether fall to the ground if these estates, or
the districts containing them, were not protected by the law
of settlement. His opinion was that if the Bill was not
altered it would not work.
Mr. FRENCH opposed the amendment.
Sir W. BRA BA ZON opposed the Bill on general grounds,
and warned Ministers against attempting to carry suck a mea-
sure into operation in Ireland, where Ministers at present had
a good name, but which they would lose if they followed up
this Bill.
Sir E. SUG DEN would support the clause as it stood.
Mr. O'CONNELL said that without a right of relief a
settlement was the idlest thing in the world. At the same
time he must own that lie did not know how they could tran-
quillize Ireland without giving a settlement. He was reluc-
tantly compelled to vote for the amendment of the Hon. Mem-
ber for Monaghan.
Mr. LITTON supported the amendment.
Lord J. RUSSELL wished to introduce a poor-law into
Ireland with a positive statement as to settlement.—( Hear,
hear.) At the same time he did not say that a settlement
might not become necessary at some time or other. Ile
doubted, however, if there could be any sort of settlement in-
troduced which would not give rise to endless litigation. He
should, therefore, prefer keeping the clause as it stood.
Lord CLEMENT S should support the Bill as it was. lie
thought that if they had a law of settlement they should also
establish a right to relief, and that both should go together.
Mr. WYSE thought it would be much better to leave the
discretion in the hands of the Board of Guardians than attempt
to introduce a clause of settlement into the present Bill.
Sir E. HA YES supported the amendment, because he felt
satisfied that a right of relief existed under the Bill. He could
see no fair chance of the working of the Bill, unless it were
accompanied by a law of settlement.
Mr. BARRON could not agree to the amendment before
the House.
Mr. Sergeant JACKSON thought the clause before the
House one of the most important in the Bill. His Hon.
Friend the Member for Donegal had stated that a right of
relief would exist under the Bill. He (Mr. Jackson) had
looked to the clause, and he found no right to relief. Un-
doubtedly there ought to be a right to relief from the soil or
land of any country to every person incapable of supporting
himself. He thought the aged, the infant, and the impotent
were entitled to relief in cases of destitution, and that every
principle of religion, and morality, and sound policy dictated
that such relief ought to be granted.—( Hear.) It appeared to
him that a law of settlement was absolutely necessary to make
the Bill work.
Mr. WALKER would oppose the amendment, and hoped
that the Government would adhere to the principle of the
measure.
After a few words from Mr. W. ROCHE,
Mr. SHAW thought the safer course would be to dispense
with the law of settlement rather than to adopt it. He did
not see how an inundation of labourers to a district where
there was a market for labour would be prevented by a law of
settlement. Such a law would not give the power of pre-
venting the transit of labourers from one district to another.
Under these circumstances, feeling as he said before that the
question was one of great difficulty, he thought the better
way would be to dispense with the law of settlement.
Strangers were then ordered to withdraw. On returning to
the gallery we found the numbers to be—
For the clause lO3
For the amendment
Majority
Mr. S. O'BRIEN must take the sense of the House upon
an amendment which he intended to propose by way of pro-
viso to the 41st clause. The calculations of the amount of

pauperism in Ireland contained in Mr. Nicholl's report had
been completely disproved by the Honourable and Learned
Member for Dublin : but, no matter whether the number of
paupers was 80,000 or 500,000, in his opinion the workhouse
was the most expensive as well as inefficient mode of relief.
In opposing it he had the support of large bodies of his
countrymen—he would instance the late meeting convened by
the Lord Mayor in Dublin. He had also a letter from Belfast,
stating that a petition would be sent from that place, signed
by 10,000 persons, in favour of out-door relief. The only
view in which he could favourably behold th c Bill was, that
be was sure it would work out its own enlargement. Still, wkat-
ever the fate of the amendment, he would, though he were to
stand alone, take the sense of the house upon it, satisfied that
in doing so he did but his duty.
Lord MO R PET H opposed the amendment.
Mr. W. ROCHE differed, with reluctance, from his Hoe.
Friend the Member for the county of Limerick.
Sir R. BATE SON regretted that the support to be given
under this Bill was not limited to the really destitute, and
confined to them alone. He was entirely opposed to the
workhouse system, as, in his opinion, it was one, which would
never do in Ireland. He would, on every occasion, oppose
that system, as well as the principle of affording subsistence to
the able-bodied. In his opinion, the very best measure of poor
relief in Ireland was the plan proposed in 1830 for enabling
each parish to rate itself for their support.
After a few words from Lord MORPITII and Mr. 0' CONNELI')
Mr. SHAW was opposed to the amendment.
Mr. Sergeant JACKSON did not wish to have it go abroad
that the workhouse system was one of oppression, as the lion.
and Learned Gentleman the Member fur Dublin would have
it understood. lie had that day received a letter from the
Governor of the House of Industry in Dublin, stating that the
most painful duty which he had to perform was the refusal of
the numerous applicants for admisssion.
Mr. D. CALLAGHAN was satisfied that the workhouse
system would be totally inapplicable to Ireland. He, for his
own part, desired to see the law of settlement extended to that
country. Ile should wish to have relief compulsory, and he
was also in favour of out-door relief. Without these he was
sure that any Poor Law Bill would, by the bulk of the people,
be considered unsatisfactory.
Mr. BARRON agreed with the lion. and Learned Mem-
ber for Bandon that the workhouse system was not hostile to
the habits and feelings of the people of Ireland.
Mr. P. SC ROPE would support the amendment.
Sir T. ACL AND bore testimony to the manner (as we
understood) in which the Cork House of Industry was con-
ducted.
After some further conversation between Lord Clements,
Sir Edward Sugden, Mr. O'Connell, and Mr. Callaghan, the
Committee divided, when there appeared—
For the clause 99
For the amendment
Majority
On clause 42 being proposed, which
service provides for religious
in workhouses,
Lord CLEMENTS proposed that the Commissioners
should not have the appointment of the chaplains, but that it
should be lodged in the local ecclesiastical authorities of Le
respective religious persuasions.
.•

Mr. O'CONNELL and Mr. S. O'BRIEN supported the
amendment.
Mr. Sergeant JACKSON suggested that the clause should
be orui:ted eltctrethcr, and that the inmates of the work.
le,uses should be free to worship wherever they chose on the
Sabbath.
Mr. O'CONNELL was opposed to the adoption of this
suggestion.
Lord J. RUSSELL saw considerable difficulty in the
clause, but not such as tto induce him to accede to the sugges-
tion of tl e Honourable and Learned Member. He thought
that the better way would be to postpone it until it should re-
ceive further consideration.
After a few observations from Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Shaw,
end Lord Morpeth, the clause was postponed.
Clause 43—" No inmate of workhouses obliged to attend
religious services contrary to his principles."
After a word or two from Mr. Wyse, Lord Morpeth, and
Mr. Goulburn, the clause was agreed to.
Clause 44 was likewise ordered to stand la t o 7 the Bill.
Clause 45—Repeal of existing Acts atter workhouses
erected.
Sir E. SUG DEN said that as the Noble Lord had agreed
to strike out clause 46, and as the clause had a close connec-
tion with it in parts, some amendments were necessary to
make it coherent with the principle of the Bill.
Lo.d J. CU 3SELL was understord act to object to the
first amendments, but he should just pospone the clause for
further consideration.
After a few words from Mr. SEIAW and Mr. O'BRIEN, the
clause was postponed.
Clause 46 was struck out of the Bill.
The Chairman then reported progress, and the House re-
sumed.
Colonel SIBTHORP, in reference to some Bills which
stood on the paper for second reading, observed that it seemed
to him as if the Government wished to take the country by
surprise in proposing them for that stage. Would it be be-
lieved that though they were fixed for the second reading that
night, they had not yet been printed ?
Lord J. RUS SE LL said that his object was not to move
that the Bills be read a second time, but that they be post-
poned. —(A laugh.)
Colonel SIBTH 0R P wished that that had been the general
line of conduct of the Noble Lord.--( A laugh.)
Mr. P. THOMSON moved that the following Homburg
be nominated for the Combination Committee t--The Lord
Advocate, Lord Granville Somerset, Mr. O'Connell, Lord
Viscount Lowther, Mr. Charles Villiers, Mr. Hume, Sir
Henry Parnell, Mr. Crawford, Mr. Milnes, Mr. Hindley,
Mr. Pringle, Mr. Wakley, Mr. Ward, Mr. Young (of Ca-
van), Mr. Poulett Thompson.
General JOHNSON moved that the order made on the
22d of November last, for returns under the Poor-law Amend-
ment Act (No. 4) be mad© forthwith.
The House then adjourned, at Twelve o'clock.

- -
MEETING OF MIDDLESEX MAGIS-

TRATES.

There was a very numerous assemblage of the magistrates
Thursday ; and Mr. Sergeant ADAMS was unanimously re-
elected chairman.
PINSBURT RECoTERY 0? SMALL DEBTS BILL.
Upon the New Prison reports a discussion ensued respecting
the right of committing debtors from the Finsbury Summons-
ing Court to that gaol.
Mr. WITHAM said the objections to the Bill for the Reco-
very of Small Debts in Finsbury were, that according to some
of the clauses, the Commissioners had power to send persons
committing coatempt of Court, witnesses refusing to attend,
or refusing to be examined, and debtors to the New Prison.
If the proposed Bill was agreed to it would throw the expense
of lodging thcso persons on the county at large.
After some discussion it was proposed, that a petition to
the House of Commons, and a memorial to the Secretary of
State, should he presented against the Bill, and that the
Member for the county be requested to support the prayer
thereof.
Captain Woos, M. P., thought the Bill objectionable, and
that tho Government would oppose it, the more especially as
Lord John Russell had a Ministerial plan on the subject.
The petition to the House of Commons, and the memorial
against the pending Bel, were agreed to.
TUE INTENDED METROPOLITAN IMPROVEMENTS.
Sir J. S. Limes called the attention to the proposed new
street or road from Oxford-street to the Sessions-house, and
from thence to the eastern part of the town. Several gentle-
men who had been examined before the Committee were in
attendance to present their plans, and he should therefore
move that they be called in.
At the suggestion of Mr. Sergeant ADAMS, it was agreed
that the plans and all otter matters connected with the "
provements," should be referred to a Committee.
It was also carried that Sir J. S. Lillie, Mr. Pownall, and
Mr. M`William he added to the Committee.
TIE SEPARATS AND SILENT SYSTEMS 01 FAISON DISCIPLINE.
Mr. HOARE moved—
" That the ,special report of the visiting justices of
ems
House of Correction as to the separation and silent ertn!:
of prison discipline be taken into consideration; and that
be referred to the Visiting Justices to make a report oli°°
the circumstances pointed out by the Governor in the
pendix to the Report, which obstruct the operation of the pr-
sent system of management, and give eccasion to some of the
objections that aro urged against the system."
The Hon. Magistrate, in support of his motion, read long el-
tracts from the Parliamentary Reports, and those of the Visit.-
' ing Justices, and Captain Chesterton.
Mr. PAINTER followed in a very lengthy written address
to the Court, in which he detailed various statistics in rela-
tion to the American and Continental systems, as contrasted
with the English Prison discipline.
Mr. LAURIE said, that the Hon. Magistrate who had last
spoken referred to the Prison discipline in England and Ame-
rica. The difference between the two countries in that parti-
cular was as light to darkness. Were the Magistrates of this
country to seek for humane rules and regulations in America ?
Let the Gentlemen he was addressing look to facts. h.°Glasgow gaol system of separate confinement more closely
approached the American than any other in this kingd°amted
let them look at the result. Mr. Hiil, in his Report, St
that in London, under the silent system, the deaths Were 3e
per cent ; in Glasgow, under the separate, 50 per cent.
(Hear, hear.) The Learned Magistrate proceeded to shovel.
the evils of the separate system, and instanced the eases °

bone workhouse, who had been reduced to idiotcy. 113°
mind of Welsh was rather of an intellectual character here-
tofore. Both were of bad habits, and, having escaped out
of the workhouse, committed a burglary, for which °fen"
they were convicted and sentenced to twelve months it'"
prisonment in the Penitentiary, in " separate" confincntent:
When they went in they were in full possession of their
senses; when discharged they were confirmed irremediable
idiots.—( Hear.) He had seen one of them and any Magirs"
trate might visit the place in which they were confined•
another case, a woman named Newman, aged about 23, who
had been tried in that Court, and who had been sentenced to
the Penitentiary, was removed to Bethlehem Hospital, having
gone mad under the separate system. What, then, could be
expected from such an absurd system ?—( Hear.) But worn
remained to be told—children of tender age had been sole
tensed to separate confinement, one ei years only. She has'
been placed in a solitary cell. He would appeal to the Chair-
man as to the truth of the statement.
The CilAihmAN said it was quite true, and that, under the
prison orders, they must remain for the long term of their
sentence two years it was understood) in the same state
They, however, were taught needle-work, and allowed hi."
n hour each day for exercise. When questioned, it was
dent they knew little or nothing of conversation.
Mr. LAURIE hoped the Secretary of State would be ills
formed on the subject, and that such a blot upon the country
would be wiped off.
7 he Ciesieseee remarked that the Magistrates had no con-

trol over the discipline at tho Penitentiar-y.
Mr. LAURIE—No ; it was under the control of the Govern-

meat inspectors.—( Hear.)
Mr. Toot said, that as to the woman, it was known she had
feigned madness; but it being believed she was insane, she
was rem wed to Bethlehem Hospital. As to the infant seven
and a half years old only, he must express the strongest repre-
hens"on of her imprisonment. She was a mere child, of veil
infantile appearance, and when asked in her solitary cell what
she wished for, she replied, " I should like to have a doll."
Could such a child know anything of crime or punishrue"t ,
(Loud cries of " Hear, hear.") When the matron occasion:
ally visited the three children in their separate cells, she foto°
the little creatures each endeavouring to amuse itself by mak-
ing a doll of the clothing in tke cell. The child seven and $
half years of age kad been found guilty of stealing soul
trifling articles, and her mother of receiving them ; and a In°s
extraordinary sentence had been passed. The child was 6en-
teneed to seven years' transportation, and tke mother to sot
months' imprisonment.—( Loud cries of " Hear.")
The CHAIRMAN—Not in the Court.
of the:l
Mr. TuLe—No. On account of the tender age
former she was sent to the Penitentiary, as had been state
fie thought the Government Inspectors' plan would be
In-
jurious.
The motion of Mr. Hoare having been agreed to,
Mr. 'nee moved—
" That the Court do take into consideration a plan tofhhe
adopted in the House of Correct,'.on in Coldbath-fields,
shall combine the advantages of the separate and silent aYs;
terns, without any important alterations in the construction 0'
the prison."
osition
The lion. Magistrate then went into a very long t°
cap
of his views, and proposed plans which it is unnecessary natter
state as in the end it was carried that the whole matter.
should be referred to a Committee to report upon at the next
County Court.
M
r. BROUGTON wished to ask Mr. Hoare, whose k!
ledge in such matters was very great, if that, when he allud nowed
to the silent system in America, he had said, that prisonela
sentenced to the separate system were not allowed to pass th
threshold of the cell ?
Mr. lioArts—Yes. If for thirteen years, they are not al-
lowed to pass the threshold. the
The CHAIRMAN knew from a conference with one of
Government prison inspectors, that, in their plane when a,
prisoner entered a cell, he should never leave it, whatever
might be the term of imprisonment, without a surgeon CO
sidered it necessary for his health—(Cries of " Shame
I 1
and that he should not hear the sound of human voice.--( n"
dignant cries of " Shame I")
Mr. GIBSON confirmed Mr. Hoare as to the American
system, adding, that in that country if a prisoner was cone
fined for life, he would never be allowed to pass the threshold
of his cell.
COMMUNICATION FROM TIER MAIESTI'S GOVERNMENT.
The CHAIRMAN had communicated with the Secretary of
State for the Home Department, and Lord John Russell had
expressed an opinion that the Penitentiary-was not a fit place

for children. He also held in his hand a document which
bore the name of " Victoria," but he did not think he tea=
anthorised in stating more at present.
On account of the lateness of the hour the other motions
and notices on the paper were adjourned.
FEBRUARY 23.

After the disposal of several trials, all of which were desti-
tute of the least public interest, the Bench resolved itself into
a County Court, fur the purpose of receiving the Report of
" the Committee appointed to consider the expediency of re-
commending her Majesty's Government to bring in a Bill to
limit the opening of houses for the sale of spirituous liquors to
the hours prescribed for coffee-houses and beer-houses, and
to forbid the opening of such spirit-houses altogether on Sun-
day mornings ; and to empower the Magistrates to license
certain houses for the sale of tea and coffee, and other unin-
to.sicating refreshments, to be open in the night time in situa-
tions where they may appear to be necessary for the reason-
able accommodation of the public ; and to suggest such modi-
fications of existing laws, in regard to public-houses, as may
appear to them to be necessary."
The report was then read by the deputy clerk of the peace,
and submitted among other things, that it be respectfully re-
commended to her Majesty's Government to bring in a Bill to
limit the hours for the retail sale of strong beer, wine, and spi-
rituous liquors, to between 6 o'clock in the morning, and I 1
o'clock at night, and that such houses be cleared of their
guests before half-past 11 o'clock at night, but on Sunday
mornings that such house be not open before 1 o'clock, p.m.,
and that the magistrates in petty sessions, subject to appeal to
the general sessions, be empowered to licence persons to keep
houses in situations which they may approve of, for the sale of
tea, coffee, and other refreshments, not being of an intoxicat-
ing nature, to be open in the night time, such houses to be
thereupon open to the inspection of police.
The report having been received,
Mr. BEAVMONT, the Chairman, could not but congratulate
the Court on a fact which must have presented itself to their
notice, namely, that the vice of intoxication was very much
diminished, not merely in the higher circles, but in the mid-
dle and lower classes of society. The honourable magistrate
at some length went on to describe the dreadful and disgusting
scenes which presented themselves to the respectable families
on the Sunday morning on their way to Church, as at a few
minutes before eleven o'clock on those days, it was the cus-
tom for the different public-houses and gin-palaces to turn out
the parties who had been throwing away their time and their
money during the earlier part of the Sabbath within their
walls; and concluded by moving that " the resolutions of the
Committee be presented to the Secretary of State."
A long, but somewhat desultory, conversation arose, in the
course of which it was suggested, whether, as the subject was
of such importance, and so many interests were affected by
the terms of the resolutions themselves, it would not be the
most advisable plan to call a Special Meeting of the Magis-
trates to take the whole matter into consideration. Ultimately
that proposition was agreed to, and Tuesday, the 21st of
March, appointed for that purpose.
[ln reference to the period when the Learned Chairman
(in our Report of yesterday) said that the little girl of seven
and a half years of age had been committed to a separate
cell in the Penitentiary, instead of its being " in the month
of January," it should have been in the month of January,
1837." So that the poor little creature was condemned to
three years' imprisonment under the " separation" system.]

MARVLEBONE ELECTION.
MEETING AT THE YORKSHIRE STINGO.
Yesterday a numerous meeting of the electors of Maryle-
bone was held in the large room of the Yorkshire Stingo
Tavern, commonly designated the Apollo Saloon, for the
purpose of determining and giving expression to their opinions
as to which of the candidates on the Reform interest were
best entitled to the support of the electors, and were the most
fit and proper persons to represent the borough of Marylebone
in Pasliament. Long before the Chair was taken the room
was crowded to suffocation, and the greatest enthusiasm pre-
vailed in favour of Mr. Ewart.
At one o'clock, JOSEPH HUME, Esq., M.P., was called to
the Chair. The Hon. Gentleman urged upon the electors the
necessity of union, and the superior claims of Mr. Ewart to
their suffrages.
Mr. POTTER moved the first resolution, to the effect, that
in the opinion of the meeting, unity was the only means to
prevent a Tory becoming the representative of Marylebone,
and that it pledged itself to support the most popular candi-
date on the Reform interest.
Major REVELL seconded the resolution, which was carried
amidst the most enthusiastic acclamation.
Mr. ROBINSON moved the second resolution, that Mr.
Ewart was considered by the meeting as the most fit and
proper person to represent the wishes of the electors of Mary-
lebone in Parliament.—( Cheers. )
ASIITON YATES, Esq., M. P. for Carlow, seconded the re-
solution.
The resolution was then put from the Chair, and might be
said to be carried unanimously, there being only three hands
held up against it. The result was received with great marks
of approbation.
Tho CHAIRMAN then said, that in introducing Mr. Ewart
to their notice, he would beg to state that he sat beside that
gentleman for seven years, whilst he (Mr. Ewart) was the re-
presentative of Liverpool, and that during that time he had
never known him to give a vote that was not in furtherance of
popular rights.—(Cries of " The Poor-laws.")
Mr. EWART then came forward, and was received with deaf-
e,Hing cheers. He said, that unless he had been convinced
that that great body were favourable towards him, he never
Would have obtruded himself upon their notice.—( Renewed
Cheers.) Had he found that any other candidate upon the
Liberal interest, professing the same principles that he did
himself had pre-occupied their favour, and was the object of
their choice, he would have most unhesitatingly withdrawn.
His Hon. Friend (Mr. Hume) had said that the man who
Came before them to solicit their suffrages should be unfettered
by either of the great parties who swayed the State, both of
whom possessed too great a preponderance in administering
the affairs of the nation.—( Loud cheering.) If then, the
absence of such fetters possessed any charm in the eyes of
the electors of Marylebone, he (Mr. Ewart) was ready to
proclaim that ho was the man.—( Immense cheering.) Ile
would not seek to inquire what measure hnd been introduced
by Whig, or what recommended by Tory, his only object
would be to ascertain what would be for the good of the peo-
Ple•—(Cheers.) He ( Mr. Ewart) had used his utmost exer-
tions in endeavouring to procure for the people an extension
of education.—( Loud cheering.) He would give to them an
Uncontrolled extension of the power of voting ; and, if any per-
son doubted his word, he would refer them to the votes lie had
already given on the subject, and if they were dissatisfied with
parole evidence, they would perhaps consent to take documen-
tary—(Loud cheering.) He had also voted for the repeal
of that most obnoxious tax, aye, he would say, the most so that
was ever imposed upon the public, viz.—the Corn Laws.—
(Cheers.) Upon the subject of the Poor-laws he had been
already anticipated by the voices of several of his fellow-
countrymen, who had raised the formidable phalanx of the
Pour Law Amendment Act.—( Hear.) He would ask them
why he had supported the principle of that measure, and he
would answer the question himself by stating that lie did not
Support it as one of legislative perfection.—( I fear. ) He merely
supported the principles embodied in the Act, which were the
results of past experience, and which were favourable to the
condition of the British labourer.
A voice—Quite the contrary.
Mr. EWART—Did not the people of Marylebone support
the principle that actuated the administration of the Poor-law
in the parish of Paddington ?—(Cries of " No, no," and
" Yes, yes.") He (Mr. Ewart) for the same resson, had
supported the principles embodied in the Poor Law Amend-
ment Act. But he was far from supporting many of the
Clauses which he held to be obnoxious, and which ought to be
removed.—( Cheers.)
A person in the crowd—You supported the Bill altogether.
Mr. EWART—A gentleman in the crowd more ready with
assertion than prompt with proof, has said that ha (Mr. Ewart)
had supported the Bill altogether. Now, if that gentleman,
hovvever, had consulted his proofs, he would find that he ( Mr.
Ewart) had invariably voted against all the objectionable
clauses of the Bill.—( Cheers.) He had been asked if he was
favourable to what had been called the Triumvirate sitting at
Somerset House, and he would now answer them once for all,
that he was one of those who had said in their places in the
House of Commons, that that Commission should be limited
to a certain number of years.—(Cries of " Hear, hear.")
He considered the great metropolitan boroughs as the strong-
holds, the citadels of freedom, and now whilst the enemy
were raging without the walls, and threatening them with
hostile incursions, he would ask them, would they be guilty of
the folly and impolicy of allowing disunion to reign within ?
(Immense cheering, and cries of " No, no.") No, they
should unite, and by one determined effort, overthrow the ma-
chinations of their enemies.—( Renewed cheering.) Mr. Ewart
concluded by stating, that he entertained the greatest respect
for Colonel Thompson, as well as being in the enjoyment of
his personal fi icndship, and had he found that the Gallant
Colonel possessed a clear majority of the electors of Maryle-
bone in his favour, he (Mr. Ewart) should have shaken hands
with him, saying—" You, Colonel Thompson, arc the chosen
of
Marylebone, and I shall never take my stand on a minority
against the expressed, the declared, and the recorded wishes
nice electors." Mr. Ewart sat down amid general cheering,
ich lasted for several minutes.
110VENDEN then moved a vote of thanks to the Chair-
Lilan, which, being seconded, was carried unanimously, and the
'fleeting separated.

CONIPORT TO PERFORMURS.--WllO has not been
sexed with the uncompromising character of a bound Music
hook? Who has not been vexed with himself' that he should
`4ve been irritated at the puritanical stiffness of its back, and
tale romantic affection of its leaves; baffling all attempts to
Qeeet a separation, " like twin roses blown apart," rushing
together at a given opportunity ? Who that loves comfort in
PlaYing, better than a dainty binding, has not marred the one,
that he may enjoy the other ; that he may at all events play
three bars without a forced rest to persuade the leaves to
moderate the ardour of their attachment ? To such per-
formers we announce the glad tidings, that one Mr. William
Hancock (Manufactory Glass House-yard, Aldersgate-street)
has invented a mode of binding in Caoutchouc, which whether
the Book contain 50 or 500 leaves, both the first and the last
IQ lie as flatly as if it were wholly free from any tie.
loreover, such is its elasticity of binding, that the Book may
be turned completely back at any division of the leaves, and
" lease no show of violence behind." In short, the invention
i 8 as clever as it will be welcome to all classes, literary,
musical, and commercial. In a Ledger of 800 leaves you
InaY write upon any page to the very edge ; and a small
octavo Book will lie perfectly flat, unrestrained, open it where
You may.

SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS

One of the most magnificent displays of intellect and
oratory that was ever made in the British Parliament,
or perhaps in any other assembly in the world, was Tuesda)
night exhibited in the House of Lords by Lord
Brougham, on bringing forward his resolutions on the Slave
question. When we thus see the highc4t order of mind'
and the most splendid and brilliant efforts of elo-
quence addressed to the mitigation of human misery, and
the elevation of man of every clime and colour in the
scale of existence our hearts glow with hope, and exulta-
tion at the prospects which are thus opened to suffering
humanity. Lord Brougham's previous exertions on this
subject, when he brought our West Indian relations un-
der the notice of the House of Commons, and the une-
qualled zeal and ability with which he pursued the ques-
tion of Negro Emancipation to its ostensible accomplish-
ments, were in themselves sufficient, without one other of
the manifold claims which he has put forth on the public
gratitude and esteem, to enshrine him in the deepest affec-
tion and most exalted veneration of every man solicitous
for the welfare of his kind. Gigantic and almost super-
human as arc his Lordship's intellectual powers, and his
unequalled facility of putting them in action, when he
considered the great success which attended his former
labours, and tho proportionably great expectations which
had been formed of his present efforts, he might well feel
the anxiety expressed in the commencement of his
speech, which he described to be greater than he ever be-
fore experienced on addressing either House of Parlia-
ment, save on the occasion already referred to, that of bring-
ing the subject of the ill usage of our West Indian relations
first under the consideration of the House of Commons.
Whether as regarded the surpassing interest of the
question, or the exalted position of the statesman and ora-
tor who introduced it, the announcement of the proceedings
of Tuesday night could not fail to have excited the most

anxious solicitude of the public. But however—great may
have been the anticipation, it must have fallen short of the
reality, for it is to bo doubted if eve❑ Lord Brougham
himself had expected to have produced such a powerful
effect on the House as was manifestly wrought by his
address, He at first impressed upon their Lordships the
favourable occa=ion which thus presented itself of recom-
mending themselves to the good opinion of the country, and
then entering at once upon the question, ho detailed a se-
ries of cruelties contingent on the slave system which are
calculated to make the sternest heart recoil with horror.

Ile told of legions, in order to lighten the ship during
chase, being Clung overboard by pairs, in fetters, to insure
their being drowned before they could be captured by the
cruiser to give evidence against their murderers. He ap-
pealed to the Marquis of Sligo in corroboration of the fact
of vessels being engaged in the traffic which had only three
feet and a half; and even but two feet and a half between
the decks, wherein hundreds of human beings had been
jimmied like lifeless lumber. In one of these vessels the
opthalmia had broken out to :a considerable extent, and
whenever a poor unhappy wretch was seized wit it, in
place of having medical assistance—in place of a sur-
geon being called to him, he was instantly and in his
chains flung overboard, in order to stop the infection.
The mind shrinks from believing such barbarities as
these, and therefore in their very excess they become in-
credible. " I will be charged" said his Lordsl4, "no
longer with under-statements. I said, that one ship had
brought 700 slaves, and I stopped there, for it was quite
enough to harrow the feelings of all ; but, my Lords, there
was another ship which brought a cargo of 980 poor, misera-
ble, unoflinding beings, and out of that 980, without any
direct murder, but from the hardships and sufferings insepa-
rate from the traffic, GOO full the victims of the pestilential
hold ; and four other ships, which sailed from the same
port, with no less than from 2,300 to 2,400, no less than
1,500 of these poor slaves, fell a sacrifice to the disease."
But we turn from the contemplation of horrors such as
these, to the more grateful task of refuting the foul and
false allegations made against the victims of these abomina-
tions, suelt as their being unfit for the enjoyment of liberty,
and that if emancipated they could not be induced to work
by the hope of remuneration, nor by any other appliance
than the whip. The first of August, the day fixed upon
for their restitution to liberty—a day affected to be looked
upon with apprehension by the taskmasters of the unfortu-
nate negroes, lest they should indulge in irregularity, ex-
cess and debauchery—passed away and returned, and
passed away again and again, without any the least serious
disturbance. We quote the following passages from his
Lordships speech :
"Three hundred and forty thousand slaves were liberated
on that day, and their peaceful festivity was disturbed only
on one estate, in one parish, by an irregularity which three
or four persons put down. But, my Lords, we were told
that that day `would be a day of disturbance, of outrage, of
disaster. We were told that there would be no volunta7y
labour, but we find now that there is no want of men to work
for hire. I have the authority of my Noble Friend behind
me (Lord Sligo), that there has been no want of labour. My
Noble Friend has made an inquisition into this matter, and
I am enabled to mention his authority for saying, that in
nine estates out of ten there is no difficulty whatever in get-
ting labourers to work for hire. And yet, my Lords, there
were people bold enough to tell us, that without the cart-
is hip no negio • could be made to work—we were told that
the negro would fall asleep when released from the lash.

"In Antigua and Bermuda, on the first
.of August, 1834,
three years and a half ago, there was not a single slave or
indentured apprentice. But it has been said that it could
after so complete and abject a state
hardly be expected that,
of slavery which had so long existed, the sudden emancipa-
tion would endanger the peace of this island. The expe-
rience of Aug. 1 at once scared away the phantom which had
been raised in tire minds of the planters. Then it was said, only
wait till Christmas, when all who have a practical knowledge
of the negro character dread rebellion. They did wait—and
I will go to Antigua, for it is the strongest case—there ;there
was no preparatory state, there there was no transition—the
chains were at once knocked off, and the negro was made
free. Fur the first time within 30 years, that year, the
Christmas of 1834, was the first that martial law was not pro-
claimed in Antigua. lon call for facts—here are facts ; you
call for experionce—here it is ; and let the man who scoffed
at us—who laughed to scorn what he called our visionary,
theoretical schemes, which were impracticable—that never
could be carried into effect without a rebellion, and the loss
of the colonies—let him come forward and deny any statement
which I made."
Through the whole of his magnificent address, his Lord-
ship was listened to with profound attention, interrupted
only by frequent bursts of applause. Lord Glcnelg an-
nounced the intention of Government to bring in a Bill on
the subject, the heads of which he explained to the House,
but we must def T their consideration—for, with the en-
grossing effect of Lord Brougham's eloquence, fresh on the
mind, it would be impossible to give them suitable atten-
tion.—Morning Advertiser.
We
were sore that the evidence afforded by the late
di vision
on Mr. Grote's motion, of the rapid progress of
public opinion in favour of the Ballot, would rouse the op-
ponents of that measure out of their fancied security,
de-
rived from the known antipathy of both sections of the
aristocracy to w,liatever tends to increase the influence of
the middle classes. Such a demonstration could hardly fail
to rouse them to a due sense of their danger, and to satisfy
them that the. question is no longer to be trilled with, as if
the Ballot were merely a wild fancy of dreaming politi-
cians. We knew that the Reform Bill, by converting the
representation of these kingdoms from virtual to real, would
lead to the Ballot as certainly as day follows night ; for in
stead of the low and venal voters, the corrupt machinery
by which the Constitution was worked, it called into ex-
istence respectable and intelligent men, not accustomed to
degradation, who would not suffer themselves to be either
bribed or bullied, but who at the same time could not for-
get that they were husbands and fathers, and that their
duty to their country could never demand from them,
at every election, that they should, in exercising
their suffrages do violence to their consciences, or expose
themselves to heavy sacrifices. The Reform Bill trans-
ferred power to the middle classes ; but the Aristocracy
refuse to perceive this, and count on intimidation and
corrupt influence for counteracting its natural effects.
The enemies of the Ballot are the enemies of independent
voting ; and we have always treated the arguments
against the Ballot as urged in bad faith, the real grounds
of opposition being withheld. flowerer, as the middle
classes have evinced a determination to make the Ballot
the question, the battle- must now be fought in good earnest,
and we are prepared for the constant display of much bird
fighting on both sides till the victory is achieved. Lord Mel-
bourne seems to be aware that the time for trifling is past.
Last night, on presenting a petition in favour of the Ballet
from Neath, he took occasion to deliver his political
creed at some length. After alluding to the statement
contained in a letter from a gentleman who had
interested himself a good deal in getting up the
petition, that up to the period of the last election the pe-
titioners had not been inclined towards the introduction
of the Vote by Ballot, but that, so numerous and glaring
had been upon that occasion the instances of intimidation
and interference with the opinions of the voters, they had
come to the conclusion that the Ballot offered the only
protection, his Lordship observed, " If the one-half, the.
one-third, nay, the one-tenth part of what he had heard
on this head be founded in fact, he could not at all won-
der at the feeling which prevailed on the subject, or that
persons suffering so much inconvenience should feel inclined
to fly for relief from it to any remedy which might offer the
smallest hope of redress." " My decided opinion (added his
Lordship) is, that if even all that has been said on this sub-

ject be true,the measure of the Ballot is one which ought not
to be adopted as a remedy. It is not my intention to intro-
duce a debate upon the present occasion ; but I must be al-
lowed to observe with respect to the m. aqire, I do not
believe that any mind is so comprehensive, perspicacious,
or acute as to be able to foresee what the consequences of
its adoption in this country would ho." This we behove to
be true ; but it applies to every great political change as
well as to the Ballot. Who could have foreseen all tile
consequences of the Reform Bill? Who yet can foresee
all the consequences of that measure If we are to resist
all measures of which we do not foresee all the conse-
quences, we must resist all change whatever. Rejecting,
as inapplicable, arguments derived from the success of the
Ballot in other countries, his Lordship proceeded to ob-
serve—
" It might succeed, my Lords, I will not take upon myself
to say it would not succeed in this country, but the very un-
certainty of its effects alarms me, and would prevent me from
sanctioning its adoption. I may, however, my Lords, speak
even more positively upon this subject ; for, putting aside all
other objections to its adoption, I do not hesitate expressing
my belief that the Ballot in no respect would prove an effica-
cious remedy fo: the evils and grievances it is intended to
cure ; and that even if those evils and grievances prevailed to
a much greater extent than they do, the Ballot, so far from
diminishing them, would add to their number, and at the same
lime introduce others of a more annoying nature. Such being
my opinions, my Lords, I have but to add, that while I have
great satisfaction in making known the wishes of any body of
my fellow-countrymen in presenting their petitions, I cannot
give my approbation to the prayer of that I now beg leave to
place upon your table."
There are two grounds of objection here—the uncertainty
of its effects, and that, instead of remedying the evils and
grievances it is intended to cure, it would add to their
number, and introduce others of a more annoying nature.
The uncertainty of its effects may tell with the higher
classes, but will weigh very little with the classes who
suffer so grievously from the want of protection. The

other ground is merely Lord Melbourne's belief, and
opposed to that belief is the rooted conviction of the
people that the Ballot will not aggravate the evils for which
it is intended as a remedy. It vv:II assuredly protect the
voter who wishes to be protected. It may in the smeller
boroughs add to the existing venality, though even that is
not quite certain ; but for that evil there is an obvious
remedy. That the independence of the middle classes can

is able and willinj to answer for his own conduct and
language to his Peers ; but we have yet to learn that the
pu; rile individual who finds himself, by a concurrence o
p 'itical anomalies and partsan m-ceFsities, the Leader of
t ie House of Commons will really dare to fulfil his stale
threat (now revived from the tomb of a previous Session's
Whig-Radical bombast) of interfering ith the freedom ofde
bate in the House of Lords. We trust that Lord Maid-
stone possesses too much personal spirit, as well as here
ditary firmness, to allow either the unmitigated brutality of
language of one ally, or the shallow froward prattle of the
other, to turn him from his purrose of exhibiting in its
naked deformity the mind of the Twin who is influencing for
evil so many thousands of his fellow-eitizens, and who,
unable to appreciate or even conceive the existence of
truth, honesty, honour, or conscientiousness in the minds
of the best educated and most refined class of the most
intelligent nations on earth, is everl ;stingly trumpeting
forth his own pretensions to all the virtues, political and
sanctimoni ms, that ever adorned the biography of Saint,
Sage, or Hero !--111orning, Post.

be secured by the Ballot- can hardly be doubted ; that the
middle classes, if secured in the independent exercise of
what the Reform Bill has given to them, will always act
with wisdom, is another question. It is evident that Lord
Melbourne shares the doubts of Sir Robert Peel on this
head. However, be this as it may, this is not an argu-
ment likely to weigh with the middle classes themselves.
The Duko of Wellington said it was his firm belief that
the conscquencce of what had t-len place during the last

few years had been to render the possession of political power
by individuals in different parts of the country infinitely
mere desirable than it had been theretofore ; and
added, " What he recollected ten years ago was not, upon
his honour, the state of things now ; matters were not at
all as they were"—that " we had gone back half a cen-
tury." It required no ghost to tell us this. Men do not
fight for the mere love of fighting, but for what they hope
to gain by it ; and the Tories, having it all their own way
till the energies of the nation were roused in the struggle
for the Reform Bill, had no occasion to resort to the coer-
cive intimidation and corruption which have provoked the
demand for the Ballot. The Noble Duke referred to the

influence of the priests in Ireland ; but conveniently
forgot that in every parish in England the parson is a
recruiting officer for the Tories. His Grace " owned
he should be very sorry to sae in England the adoption of
what was called the principle of the Ballot in regard
to elections. Englishmen had ever been distinguished

for openness of ciaareaster, and he for one should be
exceedingly concerned to find that, instead of men
coming forward openly and avowing their opinions, they
should appear to shrink from publicity, and exercise their
franchise through the medium of the Ballot-box." It is
all very well to talk of the openness of character of Eng-
glishmen. His Grace must have thought them very guli-
ble, as well as very open, if they were to be led by any
such compliment to resign themselves to the persecution
which the franchise has entailed on them. No, his Grace
may rely on it : what the Reform Bill has given to thew
that they will have in reality, and not in name. The reason
why his Grace niches them to remain open is sufficiently
obvious. Their openness places them at the mercy of the
aristocracy. When did ever a combatant find an opponent
too open to his weapon.—lllorning Chronicle.
We know not whether many of our readers look to so
abject a portion of their fellow creatures as those who are
the melancholy inmates of prisons and the objects of prison
discipline. Such, however, as turn their attention to these
things would, we think, have their eyes suffused in tears
when the real the account in our journal of yesterday of
the three poor children, one seven, one eight, and the other
about. ten years of age, confined in separate cells at the
Penitentiary. With this prison it appears that the Magis-
trates have nothing to do ; it belongs entirely to Govern-
ment, where they and their political economy friends, the
humanity-mongers, carry on all their experiments upon the
human frame, bodily and mental. Is it credible that chil-
dren of the tender ages above-mentioned should have
been placed in confinement separately day after day,
week after week, month after month, and, had there
not been a burst of indignation amens, the Magistrates,
year after year ? The youngest asked' for a doll, poor
little creature ! to play with ; and the others made up
their bed-clothes into the form of dolls, and so played with
them. They had been convicted, it appears, of stealing
things to carry to their mother, who was only sentenced to
'six months' imprisonment. Did the Magistrates who thus
sentenced the mother add this torture of separation to the
imprisonment of the children ? If so, who arc those Ma-
gistrates ? If not, who dared to add the separation from
each other, and from every human eye, to the sentence on
the children ? Let any one think of the feelings of
in-
fants seven, eight, or ten years of age, when darkness in
the solitude of death began to close upon them ! A mer-
ciful dispensation might /Ilford them an escape into idiotcy.
But if their senses remain, as their cries could not be
heard, or must not be regarded, what a situation for one
night only, and how much more for years of nights, for so
the sentences imported ? Anti to this it is that we are
some, after all the babble about prison discipline ! Times.
In the course of a discussion last night, on some of the
clauses of the Irish Poor-law Bill, an interesting conversa-
tion took place on the question of settlement under the
proposed Act. Mr. Lucas argued in favour of a right of
settlement ; but he did not venture to contend, at the same
time, for the establishment of a right of relief for all per-
sons enjoying ;right of settlement. Yet, es Sir Edward
Sugden, most truly observed, to concede a right of settle-
ment, and at the same time, to refuse a right of relief, would
be the most cruel of mockeries ! By withholding the
right of relief, even though it does not concede the right
of settlement, the prOjected Poor-law fur Ireland is the
most cruel mockery that ever was perpetrated by a body
of legislators. .The misery in Ireland caused by impotence
and ago—alshough doubtless considerable in amount—does
not approach to one tithe of that mass of miscsy, which
is induced in Ireland by want of employment. To
promise relief; therefore to age and impotence—and, at the
same time, obstinately to withhold relief, from men who
can find no market for their labour—is scarcely to lessen
the amount of misery in Ireland ; whilst, at the same time,
such a course is calculated to reader the unrelieved la-
bourers more desperate, and more unmanageable, than the y
have hitherto been. Mr. O'Connell declared that he
should vote for establishing a law of settlement ; and the
law of settlement being conceded, the right of relief ought,
he contended, to be conjoined with it ! Daniel, then, after
all his violent opposition to the true principle of a Pocr_
law ,is about to veer round at last to something like a qua
litied advocacy of that principle! Lord J. Russell opposed
the establishment of a law of settlement. Hedeelared his own
Bill to be the best of all possible Bills. Ile did not think that a
larger measure of relief could be safely conceded to Ire-
land ;—nor did he, on the other hand, think with Mr.
O'Connell, that the principal of relief, in any shape, in-
volved a confiscation of property. To talk of confiscation
of property, as a consequence of giving employment to
able-bodied labourers, is the quintessence of absurdity !
Whatever the able-bodied labourer receives (unless his
employers be fools) he reproduces with a imp. A sys-
tem of compulsory employment for the poor of Ireland
upon the waste lands of Ireland, would double the availa-
ble capital of that country within ten years. It is the want
of employment—it is mendicancy—it is unprofitable con-
sumption of food, and of the other necessaries of exist-
ence :—lkese are the processes, that lead to confiscation of
property. Honest employment for those willing to work,
never yet weakened the security, nor lessened the amount
of a nation's property!—Meraing Herald.
Our readers will perceive by our Parliamentary report
that the audacious insult offered to " the English and
Scotch gentry" by Mr. O'Connell has been promptly met,
and marked down for an indignant nation's reprobation, by
Lord Maidstone. The outrageous slanderer has, to the
surprise of every one, for once behaved with candour—nay,
more, he glories in the extravagant ruffianism of his impu-
tation. The secret of his very unexpected (and in this case
most steconetitutionao daring was, however, speedily re-
vealed by the conduct of the Noble Lord the Secretary
for the Home Department, who hastened to his support.
by the utterance of a counter threat of en attack upon
a Right Rel escnd Memb-r of the Upper House, for ad-
verse opinions expressed long since respecting the degree
of credit to be attached to the professions of Roman
Catholic Members of the " compact alliance." This wild
Irish mode of parrying one thrust by another, however
broadly it may betray the agency of the individual iu this
outrage against the honour of the English and Scotch gen-
try, cannot retard the retribution which awaits the reck-
less as6everater. The Bishop of Exeter, we can well be-

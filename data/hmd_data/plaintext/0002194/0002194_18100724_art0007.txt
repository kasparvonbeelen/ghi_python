The Dispatch packet, Captain HAREts, log
arrived at Falmouth from Rio Janeiro, whence sh
sailed on the the :enth of May. The following ig
an extract of a letter received by this conveyance
Rio JANEIRO, MAY t9.—A very unpleasant
circumstance has occurred at this place. Some Eng'
lish have been taken up for causing disturbances 0a
a Good Friday. They are accused of having let nh
fire-works on that day ; and they have been it"'
prisoned ever since, and are to reina;rl in CUltodY
until they quit the country. Several of them have
received wounds, and were terribly beaten by the
Police with their swolds, even after their hands
were tied behind. them. Lord STRANGFoRD l'as
hitherto declined to interfere in this affair. We
have had great rejoicings here, owing to t=le
riage of Don PEnta, the Nephew of FErtniNAO
VII. and the Princess Royal, the daughter of the
Prince Regent."
A Gentleman of the name of GRorE, a Car
taro, started at four &clock yesterday morning at
Hounslow, to go 40 miles in eight hours, for 100
guineas. The pedestrian took his route over Sun
bury Common through Staines, Windsor, Maidea-
head, and back to the nine-mile stone : he did srt
miles the first hour, but he was seven hours a"
five minutes doing thirty-five miles, and then rt"
signed.
By the Jamaica Packet we have obtained 30"
tional news respeaing the proceedings on the COO'
threat of South America, and also the folloci
letter, strewing that the spirit of instzi.reeition t
extended to the insular dependencies of Spain in Lb'
part of the world :

" CURACOA, jkl NE 52.-I am happy to inform
of the arrival of a vessel from St. Thomas, wi'icl;
announces the 161lo,.king iwelligence of Porto
having foilos.ve.l the glorious example of the C:3#
ra cca

"'A schooner of Don Pedro Cabrera, from C-W
thagena to La Gaira, has touched at this pit, 111';
in g left at the latter place the two Conitnitiso,ie
fiona Caraccas, Captain Villa Vicencio of flj
and the son of th. Marquis or Silva Ot'L,
of the Revolution in Unite, ; and the Ma-ter of "i
said schooner stated, that a novisional Governtua
had. been established."

Through the same channel we learn, that the 51);
preme Junta at Venezuela, proposes to cAI out tits
male pnpulation of those provinces from the ageive
16 to 60, to be formed under the. direelion 01 tad
Magistracy into a militia. The officers to comnizi
companies are to be seleaed from and nQuiitwed'b),
the general body, and those are to appoint their
Field Officers. The Junta has resolved to receive n°
foreign troops into teir terri%Aries on any prctel
whatever, but to trust entirely to their own intt%"l'
sources of defence.

Our letters from MAta contain the following rile;
laneholy- article of Naval Intelligence, which `•‘''
trust may prove, if not unfounded, at leat consider;
ably exaggerated :—" A few days snce, just atte
the hands of his Majesty's ships Repulse, of 74 Otis'
Captain J. HALLIDAY, had been piped on deck, a .
i7id sheet of lightning pissed along it, and struc'
one hundred of the
_men instantaneously dead 1":
We have not heard of the least accident hetalli
any other ship on the station."

The apprehension of another rupture on the froo;
tiers of Travancore. is confirmed by a letter receilet
by the last fleet, dated Lidigul, Jan. 28, stating that
Meer Khan hal succeeded in gaining partisans in 1116
South, who were to create a diversion in his tavoor'
In pursuance of this plan, while the British at(hf
was approaching Bundlecund,lave Ambeiee, tbo
i
enemy's new ally, made his appearance at the toot
the Southern Ghants, where he had culletted all tI
adherents of the late disinfeted Poligars, together
with a number of desperadoes who had been
driven into the hills during the preceo°
war in the Cochin and Travancore courorics.--.
The insurgents have possessed themselves of sja/t1
mud forts, and were at the above date bu.ily e't".
ployed in strengthening their positions, l'!icir tov-g
was increasing daily. MolAve Atnbojce, th,tir leader,
is a turbulent- eat husiast,whb had acquired popularity'
by predicting future events, but he lays no claim to
military talents.

We learn from authority in which we are disposed
to place full confidence, that LUCIE.N BuoNFO'rg
has very openly avowed his conviction of the iwpos'
sibility that the various people of the continent can ibg
submit to the system of insult, slavery, and oppres-
sion, to which they are :it present subjected,but
tltat some dreadful eunvulsion will at once thr°l
off the yoke of France, and produce a genera
anarchy This convimion, we are positively assareaT
has induced him to remit great part of his'poopedY
to America, and that a house has been actualty tal"eu
for him in Philadelphia.

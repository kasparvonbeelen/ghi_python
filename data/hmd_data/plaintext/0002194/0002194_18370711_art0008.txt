COLONIAL ACCOUNT COMMITTEE.
Dr. BOWRING moved that the evidence taken before
the Colonial Account Committee shou d be laid on the
table. His sole object in doing so was, that the evidence
which hactrilready been taken before the Committee, tvhich
was e*Ccillogly valuable, should not be lost in consequence
of-theeifiFfikt, being a sufficient number of members latterly in
attentiinci4 to form a quorum.
'Tie. SPEAKER said that the motion of the Hon.
MernbOr would have the effect of making the House
do
that which it was the province of the Committee to do.
4'P. P. THOMSON thought that the better course. for
itiAtion. Member for Kilmarnock would be to move that
• •-
-theft Members should constitute a quorum.
Dr. BOWRING was afraid that such a motion would
he attended with no effect. The number of Hon.
Members in town were so few, that several Committees
had met that morning, and had been obliged to adjourn, in
consequence of their not being a sufficient number of Mem-
bers in attendance.
The LORD ADVOCATE thought it was a question
well worthy the consideration of the House, whether a
sufficient number of Members ought not to be added to the
Committee, to form a quorum.
.77 Lord HOWICK thought that the better way would be
that the Committee should have leave to report.
After a few observations from Mr. P. THOMSON,

Dr. BOWE ING adopted the suggestion of the Noble
Lord (Ilowick), and moved that the Committee shou:d
have leave to report.

Mr. HUME then gave notice of a motion to that effect
for to-morrew.

Mr. P. THOMSON postponed the Order of the Da3
for the House agreeing to the-report of the Committee or
Standing Orders till to-morrow.

Lord SANDON begged to ask the Right Hon. Gen-
tleman, the President or the Board of Trade, whether he

committed to-morrow.

the Church Building Commission Bill.
Mr. P. THOMSON brought up papers by her Ma-
jesty's command, which were laid on the table.
Dr. BOWRING postponed his motion for Copies of
the tariffs of various countries till next Session as he un-
derstood it would lead to some discussion. In the mean time
he trusted the President of the Board of Trade would give
the matter his attention, as it was one of much importance.
The Hon. Member also postponed the introduction of his
Bill for the repeal of the Navigation Act.
Mr. HA WKES gave notice that next Session he would

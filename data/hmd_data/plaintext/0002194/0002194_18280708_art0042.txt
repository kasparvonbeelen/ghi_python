STATE OF IRELAND.

Lord JOHN RUSSELL gave notice that. on
Thursday, the 17th inst., he should move an humble
Address to the Crown upon the state of Ireland.
Mr. HUME presented a petition, from Montrose
against negro slavery; and also a petition from the
owners of smacks, trading between Leith and Lon-
don, against the Peeket Regulation Bill, and also a
petition from the Rev. Robert Taylor, a prisoner in
Oakham gaol, under the sentence of tha Court of
King's 'Bench, upon a conviction of blasphemy,
praying that the. House would -take his case into
consideration, and would do away with that disgraca
to the English law, the inflicting punishthent upon a
man for his religious opinions. The petitioner stated
that he had for years given philosophical lecture in
the city of London without interruption from the
corporate officers until the mayoralty of Mr. An-
thony Browne, a dissenter, under whose directions
the prosecution against the prisoner was instituted.
He (Mr. H.) concurred with the petitioner in saying
that it was much to the credit of the Established
Church that no corporate officer being a member of
that establishment had ever prosecuted him for his
religious opinions, and in regretting that such pro-
secution should be instituted by a man who differed
from the Established Church, and who at the time
of instituting such prosecution was hirmself receiving
a favour and indulgence from that Church by per-
mitting him to fill the high office of Lord Mayor
notwithstanding his religious opinions, which accord-
ing to the then state of the law disqualified him
from filling such office.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER
moved the Order the Day, for the House resolving
itself into a Committee on the Additional Churches
Bill for the purpose of postponing it to that day
three months.

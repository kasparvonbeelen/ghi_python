In our Front Page, we have given copious ex

tracts from the French Papers -received since
our last. The suspicion that Russia has been
intriguing for the Balearic Islands, (for our
vigilance respecting which the Otiflamme and
other Ultra Journals were pleased to assail us
with ridicule and with the charge of radicalism,)
is strengthened by a report circulated at Bayonne
at the time of M. Pozzo DI BORGO.II passage
through that place on his return from Madrid to
Paris. It was there rumoured, it appears, that

he cession of the 13alearic Isles to Russia

has been actually granted by FERDINAWD. In
an American paper it is also stated, that the

Island of Cuba is to be ceded to France
as an indemnity fur the expenses of the war
against the Constitutional Government of Spain !
If these rumours are well-founded, it would be
curious if the opposition of Great Britain should
prevent the two Powers, who have the most dis-
tinguished themselves by their exertions against
Spanish liberty, from reaping the reward for their
friendly and disinterested services to the Spanish
Monarch.

Every arrival from the West Indies, for some

time past, has brought accounts of the violent
spirit with which the Colonists of several of the
Islands, particularly Jamaica, continue to ex-
press their dissatisfaction with the colonial ad-
ministration of the Government at home, and
with the proceedings of Parliament relative to
the condition and treatment of the slave popula-
tion. Having to contend, on the one hand, with

the difficulties incident to the danger of insurrec-
tion on the part of the Negroes, because they are
subjected to the oppressions inseparable from a
state of slavery, and on the other hand with
those arising from the refractory spirit excited

in the masters of the slaves, by the efforts of the
Government to introduce such ameliorations as
may either reconcile the Negroes to their lot, or
prepare the way for their gradual and safe eman-
cipation,--placed as Ministers are, with respect
to the West India Colonies, between these oppos-
ing difficulties, the attempts to, remedy which mu-
tually counteract each other, it must be confessed
that their situation is sufficiently embarrassing.â€”
Much, no doubt, will depend on the wisdom and
prudence of Parliament, to which the situation of
the West Indies will doubtless be submitted

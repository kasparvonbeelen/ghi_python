took with him to die in Russia would not do it.
The veteran and enthusiastic army that he led to
be beaten out of existence by British valour at
Waterloo would not do it. No—Englishmen are
not to be so driven until they have been poisoned
by the atmosphere and slavery of towns. The man
who wrote this must have been thinking of the super-
stitious, priest-ridden Irish. They, indeed, are driven
—ay, beaten, like dogs—to the polling places. But
we are English and Protestants, and we will not suffer
for a moment the bare imagination of such indignity
and wrong. Again, the tenants-at-will contemplated
by Lord Chandos's clause in the Reform Act must be
holders of land for which they pay, at the least, a rent
of 501. a year. Can any piece of impudent folly go
beyond that of the assumption that men in this situa-
tion are less independent than the miserable creature
who, under the Reform Act, has a vote for Members
for towns if he pay three or four shillings a week for
the squalid stall in which he cobbles out his existence ?
Or, to take county constituencies, is it to be imagined
for a moment, by any man out of Bedlam, that the
tenant-at-will who rents ground worth at least 501. a
year in Middlesex, and votes for Captain Wood, is
less independent than the dirty little shopkeeper of
Hammersmith or Mile-end who, in virtue of his lease;
or his forty-shilling freehold, votes for Mr. Hume ?
Away with such utter nonsense ; but we have been
provoked to speak our mind upon it, and we have done
so.---Morning Post.

`ll.. BENSON, Esti rose and said—" By the
flittering distineti,ol of your choice, I am called
to the honour of this dity presiding at the %Vol-
verhomptort: Pitt Clult—an honour, which, believe
me, the belt feeling 3 of my heart teach me duly
.10 apprvci,%tte.
'' l .enter upon the situation with a conviction
of the difficulties which await me, but the in-
stances of partiality you have evinced towards tue
encourage me in a reliance on your good fellow-
ship ; and though I must own a diaitienee in the
undertaking, the cause in which we are assembled
gives tue a confidence in your indulgence and

support.
" 1 am necessarily anxious to fulfil the custom
which has been invariably observed at all public
Meetings of this kind, in this happily 105,41 land,
to slew the -homage end respect which we all
feel for our beitived King ; and though we may
not, as in former days, at the bare mention of that
title, raise our voices to the skies, still we May
hail the opportunity with emotions of reverence
best adapted to the occasion. We have all loved
our good King for his public worth, and for his
privitte vittues—and now we may view him as an
autumnal Sun, that from his rising has sited his
benign influence on all beneath him---that in his
course, in' the evening of his day, droops behind
a darkened cloud ; and though we cannot ra-
Coital!), 'entertain .tl►e hope of seeing him shine
forth again in all his wonted splendour, still do
we keep our minds directed towards him, in grate-
ful remembrance of the past, aware that he is not
yet set for ever in ►he great Ocean of Eternity.
" I,invi►e you„ Gentlemen, to fill your glasses
to the brim, and in a siltliCe suited to the soles
pity of the ilecasion, -offer up our heartfelt wishes
for the ease and tranquillity of our. beloved So.
vereign."

The CHAT4mAti then again addressed the Meet-
ing in the following manuet.:—
" In rising to address you, Gentletitten, on the
ceasiot) of our Meeting,it'is tvit my intention
long to trespass on the time which I am &Ware
should he dedicated 16 miiih and festivity.
The,Auniversary which ‘,de are this day ,as•
trembled to commednorate ia replete with so much
tatter 'to admire and to value, that, in the view
I have ever taken of national importance, our
best efroits should he employed to extend as much
as possible, an observance of it 10 our own time,
and most impressively to recommend that kite
perpetuated as the best' legacy we'can bequeath
to posterily. ,

"The attempt to trace the important opts at
that great man, whose political life we profess so
much to admire, would far, very far exceed the
limits of declamation. That life, with its conse-
quences, I would briefly say, will furnish the
richest materials for the historian, and constitute
the wonder anti admiration of succeeding ages.
't We arc told by certain Demagogues, that
our creed is incomprehensible to them anti to our-
selves; and that we know not how to define the
principles we profess ! In speaking of the poli-
tical principles I profess, I conceive that 1 dis-
close the principles which actuate every Member
of thirassociarioa. We,profess loyalty to our
Icing ; and an anxious desire to maintain invio-
late the Constitution of these realms, as establish-
ed by law. We acknowledge the constituted
Authorities of King, Lords, and Commons. We
give our unions support to the Magistracy of, the
country. We maintain and cherish the civil or-
ders of society, and in one common compact hold
ourselves bound to the furtherance of whatever
may be considered for the general good of the
country. _

c, This our observance, and this our devotion),
can only be incomprehensible then to those who
ere blinded, by their prejudices—whose love for
Republicanism will suffer them to discover nothing
hut deformity in the Constitution of a limited
Monarchy—whose ecstless dispositions are, bunt-
ing incessantly for change4-4atml who in that
change- would trample nutlet. toot every social
compact, in pursuing their visionary schemes of
speculative ambluion.
ti'f( I repeat the noxious hope, that the semi-
'petits and principles We profess may not only be,
fostered by am selves, but impressed ill Eile ton t'
foteiblc manner upon the minds of those, who,
in the worst of things, we might • expect should
succeed us. Actuated by like-feelings as on the
proposal of the first toast, I request that what I
am now about to propose to yon may be drank
in full glasses, and in solemn silence

indulgence, suppress his sentiments of joy and
exultation at this pleasing matalestation of at-
tachment to prinpiples, whose effect had been
not only to secure the British Empire from poli-

slavery. Similar, be was sure, must he the feel-

IN THE UPHOLSTERY ARRANGEMENT

the greatest attention is paid to unite elegance with economy in character
for the drawing-room, boudoir, dining-room, library, and bed-chambers,
from the most quiet to the most co it styles. In the various articles of
chintzes, moreens, damasks, silks, &c. A great variety of the most splen-
did and novel styles are constantly on vi w of these qualities which can
alone insure permanent satisfaction ; the extreme disparity irr prices in
these articles, mainly arises from the inferiority of the fabric.
CABINET, CHAIR, AND SOFA WORK,
manufactured of the most seasoned materials. In the finish of Chairs,
Sofas, Sm., much depends on the quality of the materials used, and the
workmanship. It may not be unworthy of remark that a simihr effea
may be produced at a saving of nearly one half, but a hich in the wear
must eventually prove a serious disappointment to the purchaser. This
applies also to the manufacture of Cabinet Goods, which from being made
of unseasoned materials and unsound work (that cannot be detected by
the casual observer), can never be of that service and durability so es-
sential. H. L. C. begs to add that he manufactures them on his own pre-
mises, and has always on hand a large stock of well-seasoned materials,
which enables him to produce work at the ',west possible rate, and of a
superior quality.

DUBLIN ELECTION COMMITTEE

(Continued from The Sun of yest2rday.)
The Committee having retired and considered the ques•
tion, decided that the wide street tax was a municipal tax
under the fifth section of the Reform Bill.
Mr. THESSIGER then proceeded to object to the vote of
William Henry Curly, on the ground that he was six
months in arrears of the wide street tax at the period of
the last election ; and, finding that Mr. Austen objected to
the warrant under which the tax was imposed, he proceeded
to contend that, as the tax was imposed by a presentment
of the Grand Jury, that the warrant had nothing to do with
imposition, and consequently it was not a good ground of
objection.
Mr. AUSTEN was proceeding to reply, when he was in,
terrupted by the announcement that the Speaker was in the
Chair.

The Committee then adjourned, at a quarter to four
o'clock.

Mr. O'Connell still continues in a majority of one.
The question now under consideration is one of consi
derable importance. Upon it depends, in a great measure,
as we understand, the result of this inquiry.
COIT

RT OF COMMON COUNCIL.

Yesterday a Court was held specially, in conseqnence
a requisition to the Lord Mayor, to consider the propriety
of petitioning the Houses of Parliament against a Bill now
pending in the House of Commons for the removal of
Smithfield market.

The REMEMBRANCER acquainted the Court that a Bib
had been brought into the House of Commons, entitled
OA Bill for the Relief of Persons elected to Municipal
ffices, and entertaining conscientious objections to sub-
scribe the declaration provided and enjoined by an Act
made in the 9th year of King George IV., for repealing
so much of several Acts as imposes the necessity of re-
ceiving the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper as a qualifica-
tion for certain offices and employments."
It was referred to the General Purposes Committee to
watch the progress of the Bill, and report from time to time.

THREATENED REMOVAL OF SMITHFIELD MARKET.
Deputy HICKS (the Chairman of the Markets Com-
mittee) brought up the report upon the Bill lately brought
into Parliament to amend and enlarge the powers of an Act
passed in the last Session of Parliament for the establish-
ment of a cattle market at Islington, in the county of Mid-
dlesex. The report stated as follows :—We, your Com-
mittee, still feeling the importance of continuing the business
of Smithfield market on its present site, for the purpose of
promoting the trade of this metropolis and the public con-
venience, and anticipating the very mischievous conse-
quences that must necessarily ensue if the said Parshould
pass into a law, the effect and object of which will be to
create a monopoly in the hands of John Perkins, Esc',
his heirs or assigns, or the owners for the time being of the
said market at Islington, and to place the whole supply of
cattle required for the metropolis under the power of one
individual, we aro of' opinion that the same should lie stre-
nuously opposed. We have therefore directed the Remem-
braneer to prepare drafts of petitions, to be presented to
both Houses of Parliament, for the purpose which we have
approved, and recommend this Honourable Court to adopt
the same accordingly."
After some observations from different members against
Mr. Perkins's Bill, the report was agreed to by all in the
Court, with the exception of Mr. Lawrence.
Petitions, founded upon the report, were then agreed to
be sent to both Houses of Parliament, after which the
Court adjourned.

WESTERN CIRCUIT.—T4UNTON, APRJ 9.
NISI PRIUS.—BOBTIINVICK ESQ. V. CERBOC,LD KND OTHERS.
Mr. SeirSant WILDE had the holiour 'be Counsel for
the Ofaitiff, and the jury had learned fliat the substance of
the action was that the plaintiff alleged that the defendants
published a certain libel, in wUch libel they had made impu-
tations of a very serious r,ature against his character and con-
duct, and the defen,Lnts were there to-day to say that those
imputations were true. Mr. Borthwich, the plaintiff, was a
gentleman of the age of 30, and in the election of 1845,
which took place after the dissolution of 1834, he was a can-
didate for the representation of the borough of Evesham,
and it was upon that occasion that the defendants had
thought fit to publish in the Bath Guardian the libel of
which he now complained.
The libel was then read ; it was in the %Bowing terms :

" To the Electors of Evesham.
" Your suffrages have been solicited, according to the
Gloucestershire newspapers, by a Mr. Peter Borthwick, now re-
siding at Claverton, near Bath. As it may be of some im-
portance to your interest to know who the candidate is that
demands to be your representative, and as I may be mistaken
in the man, it may be well for you before you promise your
votes' to ask the person who addresses you under that name
the following queries. I believe the compass of five years,
more or less, will contain the adventures they involve, always
provided the Mr. Peter Borthtick now living at Claverton
be Mr. Borthwick late of Dalkeith, who was recently an itine-
rant lecturer on slavery. _
" Arc you not of Scotch parentage, reared a Presbyterian ?
" Were you not a small bookseller or stationer in Dalkeith ?
" Were you not a bankrupt ?
" Were you not afterwards sent by a charitable individual of
the English Church in Edinburgh to Downing College, Cam-
bridge at his sole expense? Did you do justice to his patro-
nage, and devote your time to University pursuits the usual
period, or how came you to leave Cambridge ? Is it true that
your term there ended not in College ; and if so, did it end in
gaol ? and if so, explain the transaction. •
" Is it true that you took to the stage and failed ?
" Is it true that after this you itinerated Great Britain to
make spec ekes against slavery emancipation at the cost of the
planters ?

" Is it true that now you make orations and are put forward
to advocate the Conservative interest ?
" Is it true that you have repeatedly denied that you are
the native of Dalkeith alluded to, and that your father live.'s
at ---?
" And is it then false that Mr. —, of Dalkeith., has iden-
tified you at Claverton' and touched a substant;:ai proof that
you arc the Mr. Peter Borthwick of Dalkeit',, ?
" Were you not identified at Edinburgh by Mr. Grevil—
and did not that gentleman publish the fact in the Scotsman,
in consequence of some misinformed persons denying it, and
signing his name to it, no later than March, 1833 ?
" Were you not at Liverpool, and are not persons to be
found there who can identify you ?
" Now, gentlemen, if these queries are answered truly, I
should imagine that Mr, Peter Borthwick is not a proper per-
son te'represent you. 1 think, and you will think with rre,
that a representative of the people in Parliament should suffer
no doubts about his identity any more than appear in a diver-
sity of guises in so narrow an interval of time.
I am, Gentlemen, yours truly,
" UMBRA THE RAGAMUFFIN."
Mr. ERLE, for the defendant, said Mr. Borthwick had
adopted a wise course in not giving him an opportunity of
asking him any questions about him. The libel was pub-
lished on the Gth of December, 1834, and he allowed it to
sleep till the 31st of January, 1835, that being the first
time he had made application to the defendants ; they then
asked for time to make inquiries, and stating that if they
found they had mistaken the person they would make the
most ample and abject apology any man could desire. They
made the inquiries, and found the plaintiff was the man to
whom all the statements in the letter applied, and in March
they stated to the plaintiff's attorney that they were ready
to meet him before any jury and identify the man; The
plaintiff turned this in his mind through March, May,
and June, awl then commenced his aetiou, He concluded
his address, by trusting that urn rte evidence the jury
would find themselves bound to give a verdict for the de-
fendant.

The following evidence was then produced :
Rev. J. Young—Was minister of the Albion Chapel,
Moorfields : was a student at the Glasgow ministry in 1823,
24, 2.5, and 26 attended the lectures of Dr. Dick. Peter
Borthwick was a student in the same hall, for the minis-
try. Know him at Dalkeith. Thinks in 182.5. He was
then a bookseller. Has seen him in the shop attending to
the business generally. It was a small shop in which small
articles of stationary were sold. h 1835 saw the same
Borthwick in the House of Commons. He went up wit-
ness and acknowledged him by name as an old acquaintance.
He held out his hand to witness, who did not wish to be
recognised by him.
Mr. Buchanan, head clerk of Oliver and Boyd, of Edin-
burgh—They are wholesale booksellers and publishers.
Knew a partnership at Dalkeith of J. and P. Borthwick.
Peter took. the mast active part. Applied to him for pay-
ment of a bill that was due. He answered that he could
no i
pay t at that time, that he had that day been paying
his addresses to a young lady who had some money, and that
as soon as he got married he would clear off the debt. He
said the brother of the young lady was with him that
night.
Witness stated he considered it very improperin bon t 0
marry without disclosing his situation, and advised him t.tors.
0 dc-
lay the marriage until he could clear up his creditors.
Witness added that he had too large a house and too ruei).
furniture for the nature of his business. That ipurni-
Lure was nearly new, and witness advised Lim to sell part ot.

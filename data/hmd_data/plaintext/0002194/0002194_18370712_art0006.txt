We, your Majesty's dutiful and loyal subjects, churchwar-
dens and representative vestrymen of St. James's, Westmin-
ster, approach your Majesty with the most profound senti-
ments of fidelity and attachment.
We beg leave to express our regret and sympathy with your
Majesty for the loss of our late Most Gracious Sovereign,
under whose rule peace has been preserved, the laws amended,
and our rights and libertiei promoted and secured. His Ma-
jesty has carried to the grave the grateful remembrances of an
affectionate people.
We beg leave also to express our high satisfaction at the
auspicious accession of your Majesty, who, born and educated
amongst a free people, under the tender care of a wise, liberal,
and religious mother, are about to fulfil the sanguine expecta-
tions of a great and enlightened nation.
We look forward With confident hope to the judicious ap-
plication of reform to all the time-honoured, but time-worn,
institutions of our country ; to a mitigation of the severity of
our laws, and an abatement of the perplexities of their prac-
tice ; to see the blessing.: of education brought home to every
cottage door ; and, above all, the cultivation of Christian
charity amongst all classes of your Majesty's subjects.
That these expectations will be fulfilled we have a well-
founded assurance in your Majesty's gracious declaration to
your Council on your accession, and by the cheering fact of
your Majesty's having bestowed your confidence on those en-
lightened Ministers to whom we owe the extension of our li-
berties at home, and the abolition of slavery abroad.
We trust, therefore, and believe, that under Providence your
Majesty may be the appointed means of conveying peace,
liberty, happiness, and prosperity, to the millions over whom
your Majesty is called to reign.

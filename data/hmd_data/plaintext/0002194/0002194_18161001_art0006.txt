complain of unfairness in disnsksing
The lion. D. KlNltattrt rose tE) hisore the
114eeting, that Mr. Dibtlitfrs diseintOge arose en-
tirely from a feeling in the CoMMittee, that as he
bad become the proprietor of the circus, he could
not give that attention to Drnry4J:ine'tb A would
be required of him. He assured the Meeting that
Mr, Dibdin's conduct, in respf.et to the manage.
nient, entitled him to their highest cotninencla-
Sion.

Mr. Pere': Mottag (one of the SA-Committee)
assured the Meeting he tvas decidedly adverie to
Mr. Dibdin's discharge, and thought he had been
hardty theft with. He had not agreed to his tlis-
mislal.

Some hsnltory conversation then took place
lietWeen Mr. KINNAinn and Mr.Arqurnis on the
disagreements said to exist iti the, coyriet.
KINNAIRD stated, that th-eitontrariety of
Opinion complained of was the'. best .security to
the siihseribers, LIS it ;hewed no.nne per3on could
InanAze the Theatre without being subject to the
contraili of the rest.
Mr. ROBINS r",j,,ined, that Mr. Moorc's obser-
vation had lolly. confittned hitn'in his 'statement ;
nod lie way the more fiiiiioll9, in consequence, that
it siionhi as the only thing left to auve this
3ii-fmetl concerti..
Lord fitit.Lvin stated, that notice otany inten-
tion to let the Theatre must .be given,
.and a
,-Aleeting called for that express purpose.
It was generally understood this would be itn-
tnenttely adopted. Seven new Members, in lieu
of tlinse who go ant by rotation, were then tlect-
-ed upon the General Committee; and a Vote of
".flianks to Lord Holland closed the business of
the day. .

" We hare accounts from Rio Janeiro that the,
Expedition destined against Monte-Video sailed
on the 12th ult. and would touch in at St. Ceiba-
rineh, where it is expected they were to remain
'during the winter; although the inhabitants of
that city are placing it in a state of defence. The
I'ortnguese will have little difficulty in obtaining
possession of it, but we doubt much of their
succeeding on the Bank Oriental. 'rite people
here have an idea that the views of the Porto-
goese Government are directed against this, but
we presume they will permit its to remain quiet at
least until they obtain a firm footing on the other

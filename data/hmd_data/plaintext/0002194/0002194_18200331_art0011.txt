SPAIN.

The following article is extracted from Ga-•
lignani's Messenger :

" A courier extraordinary has just arrived to
the Spanish Embassy, bringing advices from Ma-
drid of the 19th, by which we learn that the
following changes have taken place :-
4‘ M. Perez de Castro, a Liberal, and former
Deputy of the Cortes, is named Minister of Fo-
reign Affairs, in the place of the Duke de San
Fernando, who is chosen Ambassador at Vienna,
in the room of M. Cevallos, who is to have a seat
in the Council of State.

" The Duke de Fenian Nunez, Ambassador at
Paris, is recalled, and succeeded by the Duke Del
l'arque, one of the first Generals who made war
against Napoleon during the late Revolution.
" The Duke de San Carlos, Ambassador is
London, is also recalled, and the Duke de Frills,
whose sentiments have always been liberal, is to
take his place.
'' Don Onis, former Minister in the United
States of America, is named Ambassador at Na-
ples,in the place of M. Labrador, who is recalled.

" M. de C ampuzzno, former Secretary of the
Embassy in London, is named Ambassador at
Dresden, in piece of M. Salmon, who is to go to
St. Petersboigh.

" The Count de Torreno, former Deputy of
the Cortes, late an exile at Paris, and now in this
capital, is named Ambassador at Berlin.

" M. de Pando is named Minister in Portugal,
in the room of Count de Casa Flores, who is re-
called."

A Vienna article in the Constitutionnel, dated
the 15th inst: contains the following paragraph

" It has recently come to the knowledge cf the Congress
that a Circular has been addressed by the Emperor ALEX-
ANDER to his Ministers accredited to Foreign Courts. This
Sovereign has nut acceded to the decision of Carlsbad and
Frankfurt, as a'3lted of him. The diplomatic paper in ques-
tion has route a great impression; it speaks in a very marked
strain of irony of the tone of confidence adopted in the ce-
lebrated Circular of the Coant de BERNSTORFF, the Prussian
Minister for Foreign Affairs. lt is said that the Emperor
will decide as to his own conduct, after camir unicating with
the Cabinet of London. The snpericr political 1.1 .as of this
Monarch, which the most enlightened part of i is subjects
hope to see one day applied to his vast Empire, as they have
been in Poland, are nut perhaps altogether in harmony with
the principles which direct certain Cabinets of Gkrmany; List
the people of the country flatter themselves that they will
not be without influence over the nature of the Institution=
vblch they believe themselves, tv be on the eve Qionainiag.

New York Papers arrived this morning to the

Ha-
vanna tie 20th ult. states, that a Government.
*esscl arrived there the day before she sailed, and a
tepurt was in circulation that the bland of Cuba
Ivas ceded to Great Britain by the Spanish Ali-

lunted the postute,of defence and expressed a de-
termination not to give it up.

TIM MISSOURI QUESTION DECIDED...—. On
Thursday last the Missouri Bill, with the Slavery
Itestrictions, as it passed in the House of Repte-
lentatives, was taken up in the Senate ; the re-
striction wasitruck out, and a regulation inserted
ill its stead, prohibiting slavery in the territories
of the United States, north of 36 degrees, em-
bracing what is termed the compromise. Thus
amended, the Bill was returned to the House;
and at a late hour of the evening, the amendment
Wa3 adopted by a majority of four. By examin-
ing the Yeas and Nays, it appears that several of
the friends of the restriction either left their posts
Of ditty, and retired to a warm supper and an
tarty bed, or, alarmed at the idle threats of their
opponents,: fled from the Home, and yielded the
victory. A letter from Washington, published in
one of the Baltimore Papers, contains a *key to
the conduct of those Members who deserted their
Poits.—" Never," says the letter, " was there a
question more warmly contested on the floor of
Congress, nor one more calculated to effect an
Object dear to the enemies of free Government.
it was said, by one Member, that the combined
influence and power of Kings and Priests could
Itot effect a separation of the Union : it bad been
tried, but in vain:'

(Prom.
.a New York Paper of the 10th March.)
THE STATE or MlssAnt.--The President has
signed the Bill which has passed both Houses of
Congress;authorizing the people of a part of the
Missouri Territory to form a Constitution and a
State Government, and admitting the same into
Me Union on an equal footing with the original
States.
°Un AFFAIRS WITH SPAIN..-111 the course of the
debate of Monday last on the Navy Appropriation
the Chairman of the Committee of Foreign
btelations, in reply to a question asked by a Metn-
er, stated, that the Committee had not yet come
to
any determination respecting our existing rela-
tions with Spain, and that he had it not in his
c'wer to say what would be the nature of the
Iteport which the Committee might eventually
kkke on the subject.
TRADE WITH MEXICO.—In a late Havannah
paper we find a Memorial, dated 12th Oct. 1819,
11:1thessed by Don PEDRO, President of the Cham-
ber of Commerce of Verez Cruz, to the Viceroy
Of
ttMexico, on the subject of opening the Ports of
:Is Kingdom to Foreign Trade. The President
;gas the adoption of 'he measure.—We know
2at this subject has employed for some years the
Fens of some of the most able men in Mexico.

We have the pleasure to present to our Readers
day, the whole of the last Speech delivered by
tir• CANNING at the dinner which tuok place in
t iv
t "Pool on the 18:b inst. in celebration of his
"Bltetion. for that town: Any praise of this
:4.astetlY composition on our part would be ofE-
-1%8 and obtrusive. But though it speaks for
ttse4 80 impressively, as we have said before, we
t:"Qt, however, refrain from adding our humble
ite to the tribute of admiration which, we are
fonvioced, will be paid to this ratriotic, pro-
-141) and philosophic Statesman, by every vc-
tiecti"g man who feels the value of the best poli-
:'1 system that human wisdom ever devised, anki
11,1 t I°ng experience has abundantly sanctioned.
h ile. .therefore, we have such a Member in the
of Commons, whose
to ,b '1 Speculative and offic'd instruments,"
'eak lii the language of SHAKIPEARE) so well

gnalify him to sopp;irt the true interest and ho-
nour of the Empire, by his transcendent oratorical
powers, as well as by the accumulated stores of
his pregnant mind ; while, also, we have
in the other House the Earl of LIVERPOOL,
a Nobleman whose open, upright, :and intel-
ligent character even the breath of factious ca-
lumny has not attempted to sully, though it so
copiously vents its defamatory virulence on all his
Colleagues, we shall bare little to fear float any
radical inoculation in the new Parliament, per-
suaded that the Government of the Country is
vested in such hands as will be unceasingly em-
ployed in the most zealous efforts to keep it in
a state of " sound and pristine health."

MR. MELLISH.—Far from being surprized that
this Gentleman has at length relinquished the
Contest for the Representation of Middlesex, we
should be more surprized that he had rriaintained
it so long, if we had not the fullest confidence in
bis sincere regard for the honour of that County,
and the welfare of the Empire. Except on that
ground, we should be astonished that a Gentleman
of his independent fortune, high chat acter, and
gentlemanly habits, should every day have exposed
himself to thd infamous abuse of a senseless
and infuriated rabble. Nothing but true public
spirit could have induced him, day after day, to
submit to outrages so dishonourable to human
nature, as well as to the character of English-
men. NVell may he say in his parting Address,
which we have inserted this day, that " the Con-
test bad assumed a character in which defeat is
not accompanied wiih disgrace ;" for he has had.
the honour of being rejected by those whose sup-
port was infamy, and his Opponents have only to
boast of an ignominious triumph over 'froth, Ho-
nesty, and genuine Patriotism. We are persuaded
that the very time which Mr. MRLLISIS chose for
his resignation of the Contest is highly honourable
to his character, as i; may fairly be presumed
that be was unwilling to have this solemn day
profaned by the tumultuous excesses of the horde
of miscreants who attended the Hustings ; other-
wise there is reason to hope that a resolute ef-
fort of the still remaining Voters might have se-
cured his re-election. We have only to repeat
onr declaration, that we have not. the pleasure of
being known to the Gentleman in question, and
that we were induced to give our humble aid to
his cause on a full conviction of the independence
of his principles, and the purity of bis Parliamen-
tary conduct. •

At WorCester Assizes, a cause was tried about
the, soundness of a horse, in a Clergyman,
not educatt d in the school of Tattersall, appeared as a
witness. He was confused in giving his evidence; and
a Curious blustering:Counsellor, who examined him,
was at last tempted to exclaim --=" Pray, Sir, do you
know tl:.e difference between a horse and a cow ?"
" I acknowledge my ignorance," seplied the Cler.
gyman ; "I hardly know
_the difference between a

. . _
horse and a cow, or a bully and a bull, only that a
bull, I am told, has horns; and a bully (bowing res.
pedfully. to the Counsellor), luCkily for me has
none.',.'

that much important informat,on would:be'gamed

aware that the journey had been aqually eominenc-
ed, and we lament to-say; -abil.4)l7y 'and tually ter-
initiated.
For this intelligeritie we are indebted' lo
QUARTERLY REVI'EW ; and a..' the' particulars are
certainly derived from -official sources,, are the only
ones which have yet reached this—country, and are,

our readers will be gratdied by having thetia laid be-

At is now" says the Writer in THE
.qUAETERLY
REVIEW, ". nearly two ") ears since Lord Caledun
sent a'party, at the head of which was Dr.'Coviran,
to explore the interior parts of Southern Africa, in-
teljacent between' the Cape Of Good Hope and the
River Zainbeze, which falls into the M.,zambiquc
channel at" taudarnane, in lat. about 18 deg.,Stiann
down this rver.he meant to proceed
"to its mouth,
returning front thence, by sea, to the Cope. We
are n,tppv to
.have .it in onr power to give some ac
-,couovot the progress made by this gek(tl6man. In
December, 1808, lie had reached the river Melippo
in'the country of the Barraloos near to thekouthein
tropic, having passed the tripe of ,Booshuartas who
--were visited by Messis. Truter and Somerville, in
the. year 1802. Shell, however, is ihe'ihs!ability
of all 'tali-civilised setOem-nts,,that, tti co9sequeme
of a feud which broke out among them, the town 01
Leetakoo, containing from ten to fifteen .thousand
innahitants, had been totally destroyc,:d, and, the twO'
iximes had separated. in opp.site direction . • From.
• Leetakeio to the Barraloos the surface of the country,
was extremely beautiful, andetoe soil rich and fertile
beyond that of any part yet known of South Africa..
Th,, rivers were tretikent, their streams copioUS; and
all fl wing to thnortli-westward, being; in .all pro-.
bObility, branches...of the great and rapid Congo
which empties its waters into the Southern. Atlantic
itt lat 8 deg' soujt.
.
e Barraloos, it seems, are well acquainted
Frith many of the, corarrorts which propertycan eon-.
ter ; they have fixed halvitationse and plenty of
• tie, and their land produces corn and
.varions,:kinds
of pulse; they have lined servants, and, with gtiel
we say it, out-ntrooS,'slaves, NhO are cap!ives Made
in their wars with the neighbouring tribei ::and, as
.
Dr. Cowan here first heard of Whitt:p !op!e who Vi-
sited a nation residing at the distanca of i•Aree.' or
four days journey farther north, it is more than pro-.
„hable,. ,that slavery among the Bartaloos and tlieir
neighbours- will be found to. date its origin from •
their first intercourse with Portugueze slave,traflick-
ers settled on the-coast of the Mozambique' channel:
Whatever danger may arise to Dr. Cowan and les
party from colliSion With thesl traders,' -he felt ho
appre.heasion from the-natives, whom he hitherto
had round to poses the seane berrignant and friendly
chwaeter as that which Barrow gives to theKatfers,
and IN/11-Truter. to the BOsheanas. like those, also,
they are totally black, and their countenances with-
out the least- inclination to the.negro feature. He
hadmel with 'the camel in its wild state; an animal
which had, hitherto, , not been suppowl to exist in
South 'Africl, or, indeed, and where in a state of
nature. Ht ,qe.l intelligence of a large river called
Bampoora, rtAaning eastward, which he :hoped to
reach in ten or twelve days; probably the Zambeze,
or a considerable branch of it.

" We have a*, 'heard, with great pleasure, that
a gentleman of the name of Lichtenstein, who was.
tutor in Governor-Janssen's family at the Cape, is
;bout to publish an account of the Boshuanas, among
whom he 'resided si*x months, after the visit of Mr.
rlsruter, with the view •of studying their charaaer,
customs, and language. His Manuscript
_has been
ready for some time; but such is the baneful. influ- .
ence ottrench tyranny over the press in every part
of the Continent,- thgt no:man of honour and nice
feeling'Cao titoop to the indignity of , his
sentiMents )o the revision ot a.- French inspector ;
•and Mr. Lichtenstein "is,: on. this account, still in
'doubt whether, to publish in Germany or England.
" From the•relations of these two enlighted tra-
vellers, and, from Mr. Salt's second V;sit. to Abyssinia,
we may reasonably expea a very valuable addition
'to our stock of imormation concerning that-portion
Africa wli ch lies between the Red Sea and the Cape
ol -Good Hope. We sincerely luie '1 hat the'atien-
tion of the Alrican Association .will be turned to
• the southern hart of :rile great continent, where theFe
are no relentlesi Moors to stop the progre,soi the
traveller. Already have the. northern, regions fur-
nished victims enough to the thirst after knowledge,
and to the gratification of -curiosity.", ilut however
great the-danger, However hopeless the attainment
of the Object, still new ad% enturers tu4l forward. A
German geutlinnan,,we understand, is now in Loo-
don preparing to trace the steps of Mango Park
for this purpose he has undergone the operation of
circtimcision ; and, for sothe time l ast, accustomed
himself „to the spare and acrid diet of spiders, ants,
and grasShoppers. At one time be subsisted etntrely

Africa, be Sleeps, at nightS, under a hedge in Eng-
land, in the month of December.
" • Our apprehensions for the safety of Dr. Cowan
and his companions were but too well founded.
Scarcely was, the ink dry with which we wrote,the.
preceding article, when the following intelligence'
reached Its frOm the Cape,' of =Good Hope. A Por-
tugueze, who was at that seblement when the es-.
pedition set out,' and afterwards sailed 'for MOKatn-.
bique,. returned -to the Cape in Oiitober last. Thin
man relates, that a report had reached Sofftla; just
before he left it, from the kingdom of Zaire, staring

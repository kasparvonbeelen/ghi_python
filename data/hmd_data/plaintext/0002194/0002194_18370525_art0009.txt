By GEORGE TUCKER,

Professor of Mora; Philosophy in the University of Virginia.
" This work is written with remarkable care in the collection of
facts, and with more ability than any American publication of this
kind that we have ever read As a guide to the practical
working of the American Constitution it is of great value ; it not
only delineates the theory, but exhibits the application of every part
of the federal government."—Atlas.
" The present volumescontain many interesting papers, in which
the different questions that arose as to the internal regulations or
external relations of the government of which he was a member (as
Secretary of State under Washington), are discussed by him with
much clearness and acuteness ; and these papers not merely throw
much light upon the times in which he lived, but they furnish much
valuable matter in relation to the present period. Many of the ques-
tions which were then most fiercely debated still form the subjects
of discussion. The expediency of a national bank is not yet settled.
The disposal of the revenue, the continuance of slavery, the mutual
rights of the several States, both in reference to each other and to
the Union—all of these are matters upon which much difference of
opinion exists, and which it is necessary should be understood by
any one who wishes to be able to form a judgment upon the present
political condition and the state of parties in America. The author
of this life has executed his task with ability and discretion. He
undoubtedly entertains a bias in favour of the subject of the me-
moirs ; but this perhstps is scarcely more than is necessary to make
the execution of the work a pleasurable engagement. His comments
upon the opinions and actions he records are ordinarily just and
temperate ; and he points out with much fairness the many in-
stances in which the predictions of Jefferson have been justified by
the event, and the motives he attributed to his opponents have been
shown to be unfounded. The work is one which will be read with
pleasure, and it forms an important contribution to American his-
tory."-- Globe.

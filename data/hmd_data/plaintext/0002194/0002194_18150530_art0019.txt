POETRY.

SONG;—" THE HOUSE OF BRUNSWICK."
Tune.—" 7'ze Hues at antsrasial treat.", •
Sung at the Pitt Club by Mr. TAYLOR, with great applause.
When Britain, great, and brave in vain,
Saw slavery datk'ning round,
And felt her mighty arm again
With cross and fetter bound ;
Turti'd upon Heav'n, her anxious eyes
Beheld the ,Star of Brunswlc rise.'

Broad as the beacon's sudden flame

Along the mountain's brow,
In gatlfring light the Splendour tame
To wake the land below ;
But never on the cloud of ►rar
Shone emblem, like that golden Star,

Ris'n, upon man, to set no more,
It heain'd along the wave ; .
Till Britain's Isle, from shore to shore,
The rich reflection gave.
Then stopp'd the orb its course on high,
Abort thy cradle, Liberty!

britain thy heart is firm and bold,
And been thy riative spear ;
And never lip of mortal told
To thee the words of fear ,
Nor e'er did mortal laurel 'twine
Oa helm or diadem like thine!

Yet, prouder praise; that, Li4erty,
Where'er her footsteps roam,
Teaching her sons to live or die,
Makes the green isle her home.
And while she lingers in cur sphere,
That Star shall point her temple here.

A cloud may o'er its lustre sail,
err The cloud shall roll away;
The !mod of Heav'n its radiance veil ,
It beams with dearer ray.
Still to the cations blazing far,
Blitiiin's lev'd guide ! THE Baysraneic !,twAse.

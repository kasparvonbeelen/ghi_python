IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.

HOUSE OF LORDS, Jun- 22.

In the absence of the Lord Chancellor, Earl SEA rtes •
nuftY took his seat on the Woolsack a few minutes after
Five o'clock.

The Alanchester and Sheffield Railway Bill was read a
second time.
On the ntotion of the Duke of RICHMOND, the Master
of the Mint's Salary Reduction Bill was read a second
time.
The Bishop of FERNS presented a petition from the
county of Carlow in Ireland, signed by 1500 Protestants,
complaining that they were shut out from religious in-
struction, by bring so far from a Protestant place of wor-
ship. After the petition had been read, the Rev. Prelate
brought in a Bill to amend the Act of the 43d of the late
King, and to effect the object sought by the petitioners,
which was read a first time.
The House then adjourned.

HOUSE OF COMMONS, 'LY 22.

Viscount MANDEVILLE brought up the Report of
the Committee appointed to try the merits of the petition
of Sir W. F. E:liott, Bart., against the return of Henry
Francis Scott, Esq., for the county of Roxburgh, declaring
that Mr. Scott was duly elected, and that the petition was
not frivolous or vexatious.
An Mx. MEMBER (whose name we could not learn,)
presented a petition from the Norfolk Agricultural Asso-
ciation, against the nse of molasses in breweries.
Mr. HUNT presented a petition from the electors of
Preston, praying that their rights may be protected in the
Reform Bill; also for the vote by ballot, without reference
to property or qualification. The Hon. Member then
moved for a return of the average price of corn per quarter
in England and Wal. s for the year ending December last.
Sir R. MUSGRAVE presented a petition from the
Roman Catholic inhabitants of a town i❑ the county of
Waterford, against the Vestry Act ; and also a petition
from the town of Lismore, for the abolition of slavery.
S:r H. PARNELL presented a petition from the Parish
Priests of Maryborough, against the grant to the Kildare-
street Society.
THE REV. ROBERT TAYLOR.

Sir F. BURDETT presented a petition from this indi-
vidual, under sentence of imprisonment in Horsemonger- lane
gaol, complaining of the manner is which he was treated.
The Hon. Baronet observed, that some of the grievances
of which the petitioner complained having been remedied
already, he need now do nothing more than move that the
petition be brought up.
Mr. DENISON was obliged to the Hon. Baronet for
presenting this petition, as it afforded the Magistrates for
the county of Surrey, of whom he (Mr. Denison) was one,
an opportunity to vindicate themselves from the charges of
cruelty which had been made against them by the public
papers. Mr. Taylor had been convicted by a Jury
of the most shameful and scandalous offence of burlesquing
a most sacred portion of our Christian rites--the Holy Sa-
crament. When be was sentenced he made three requests :
—I at, that he might be excused attending Divine Worship
in gaol ; 2d, to be allowed an unlimited correspondence ;
and 3d, that he might be allowed better diet. A meet-
ing of the Magistrates was held, at which it was agreed
that the first and last requests should he allowed. He was
put into an airy room at the top of the prison,
eighteen feet by twenty-four, in which the windows were
east and west, and every indulgence as respected accom-
modation and diet, but no wine or spirits, the admission
of which was contrary to the Act of Parliament, unless
when ordered by the doctor in case of illness. With re-
gatd to seeing his friends, he was allowed that privilege
at a distance of three feet from them, four hours a day,
whereas the other prisoner.) were only allowed to see their
friends at a distance of six feet, and only for two hours a
day. He was told he might hive any books or newspapers
he wished, but that it was impossible to allow him to keep
up an unlimited correspondence with his friends, because
that privilege would be used in disseminating those doctrines
for which he had been convicted. He (Mr. Denison)
hoped that he had now exculpated the Magistrates from
the charges of cruelty ; with reference to prosecutions of
this nature, he very much doubted whether they
should be adopted, because the prosecutions for religious
opinions would have the effect of spreading those opinions,
and giving the parties a degree of notoriety.
Mr. BRISCOE concurred in what had fallen from his
Hon. Friend who had last spoken, and said that no blame
whatever was attributable to the Magistrates. Considering
however, that it was a punishment only for a misde-
meanour, he thought the restriction to Mr. Taylor's
seeing his friends an unnecessary degree of hars!inas.,
though it was one of the laws of the prison. He had lwa)s
thought that the rules of Horsemoneer-lane were severe, and
had endeavoured to obtain a mitigation of them. To a
gentleman of Mr. Taylor's rank in life, having been edu-
cated at Cambridge, he thought these rules were very
harsh. He was bound in justice to Mr. Taylor to state
that the report of his having called out" gammon" in the
chapel, with a view to create laughter amongst the other
prisoners, was wholly unfounded. He was instructed
also by the gaoler to say that Mr. Taylor's conduct,
when in chapel, was exceedingly proper. Oa his first
imprisonment, Mr. Taylor had written over the door of
his cell a sentence expressing his disbelief in Christianity,
but when he saw that he (Mr. Briscoe) disapproved of it,
the words of which were these, " The evidences of the
Christian religion are the greatest curses that ever fell on
this country," he immediately ordered then to be erast d
Mr. TREVOR said every indulgence had been allowed
Mr. Taylor consistent with law. But if lie had been
allowed an unlimited correspondence, it would have been
used in disseminating those doctrines for which he
was now imprisoned. It was a matter of the highest im-
portance that the laws of this country should be properly
enforced, particularly in cases of this description : for,
if such blasphemy as that for which Mr. Taylor was im-
prisoned were allowed to go unpunished, every libel
spoken or issuing from a licentious Press would even-
tually pass without notice.
Mr. HUNT felt pleasure at the manner in which this
petition was brought forward. Formerly the complaints
of prisoners were very differently received by the House.
He had had occasion at one time to complain of a gaoler,
and all his charges against that officer were contradicted,
point blank, by Hon. Members. He, however, even-
tually succeeded in establishing the charges, and the gaoler
was removed. Magistrates ought to be very careful how
they went beyond the law. In his opinion there was no
law to justify the prohibiting of a person convicted only of
misdemeanour from corresponding with his friends. It was a
prohibition solely at the discretion of the Magistrates.
Within a mile of Taylor, Carlile was imprisoned for ad-
vocating the same doctrines, and he was allowed to cor-
respond freely with any of his friends. It was, there-
fore, no a onder that Mr. Taylor should consider this
prohibition as peculiar and unnecessary, and be put it to
the House whether such a mode of punishment, and, in-
deed, the prosecution altogether, would not make Taylor
a sort of martyr to the cause. He knew nothing of
Taylor, and never had seen him but once, and then at
a public meeting; but he thought that every indulgence
which was given to Carlile should also be given to him.
With regard to the policy of these prosecutions, he could
state that the " Poor Man's Guardian," which was brought
under the consideration of the House on a former night
by the Hon. Member for Dundalk, and which then circu-
lated about 3,000, in three weeks afterwards rose to
11 000 a week. The editor and proprietor of that paper
might, therefore, thank the Hon. Member for quadrupling
its

Captain GORDON said there was an indulgent feeling
exhibited in this House towards Mr. Taylor which wt.s
not felt towards any other prisoner, and he could
not see why that feeling should be permitted.
He could only attribute it to the power that individual
possessed of wielding the public press—that rod of public
opinion. He conceived it an injustice to the other
prisoners to allow Mr. Taylor so much indulgence, as
the mere fact of his having been educated at Cambridge
was by no means a reason for any indulgence. With
respect to the observation of the lion. Member for Preston,
that his calling the attention of the House to that seditious
pamphlet, the " Poor Man's Guardian,' had increased
the circulation, he denied the assertion.
After a few words from Mr. LAMS, Mr. O'CoNNELL,
and Sir F. BURDETT, the petition was ordered to lie on
the table.

Mr. J. A. SMITH presented a petition from the West
of Sussex against certain provisions of the Beer Bill.
Mr. A. SANDFORD presented petitions from various
places in Somerset hire in favour of the Reform Bill, for
the abolition of slavery, for an amendment of the crimi-
nal code, and for a revision of the Beer Bill.
Lord MILTON presented a petition from the Protestant
freemen of Galway, for an extension of the franchise to
the Catholics. Also from the county of Gloucester, praying
for a gradual and total repeal of the Corn Laws, by taking
off one sixth of tke duty annually.
Mr. HUNT supported the petition, and intended bring-
ing on his motion shout the Corn Laws this Session, as it
was not probable he would have a seat in the new Par-
liament.
Mr. RAM SDEN had information from Huddersfield
that the petition presented by the lion. Member for
Preston on Monday last, from that town, was not known
there, and that many of the signatures were forged.
Mr. HUNT said the petition was agreed to at a
public meeting, numerously signed, and sent to him by as

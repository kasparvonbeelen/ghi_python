CHANCERY COURT-(THIS DAY).

The Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal sat in the Court of
Chancery this morning, and took motions. Thier Lordships, on
taking their seats, read and subscribed a declaration that they
would not use any influence they might possess by virtue of their
office, as Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal, to injure or
weaken the Protestant Church, as by law established. After this
ceremony the Vice-Chancellor retired, for the purpose of sitting
in his own Court.

THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL v. THE SOCIETY FOR
THE INSTRUCTION AND IMPROVEMENT OF
SLAVES IN THE BRITISH WEST INDIES.

Mr. WIGRAISI, applied to the Court for leave to put this case in
the paper on Monday to be spoke to. The object was to have the
direction of the Court as to the application of the funds of the So-
ciety, in consequence of slavery having been abolished in the Bri-
tish' West Indies, by the Act of last session.â€”Leave given.
Their Lordships then proceeded with motions.

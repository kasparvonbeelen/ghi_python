HAMI3U RGII NAIL.

BRUSSELS, JULY 2.—The Moniteur Belre contains
two Royal Ordinances, appointing General Willmar to
the post of Ambassador to Berlin, and Mr. N. A.
Beaulieu, Charge d'Affaires in Portugal.
BISSARABIA, JULY 14.—The first-part of this letter
is merely a confirmation of the landing of the Russian
expedition at the mouth of the Tuabs without opposi-
tion. and their recovering possession of the fort, which
had fallen into the hands of the Cirgassians. " Imme-
diately after effecting the landing of the troops, the
fleet weighed anchor to return to Sebastopol. As soon
as the fortifications of Tuabs and Pesuab are completed,
the fleet is expected to return to the coast to land the
troops successively at all the forts which have been lost
and damaged, to regain possession of them, and repair
the damage that has been done them. Besides these
works, blockhouses are to be built along the whole Cir
cassian coast, each large enough for 100 men and two
pieces of cannon, which are intended to keep
open the communication between the forts and
the coast. General Grabbe, with his corps, has goal
by land from the Kuban, probably to repair the fort
St. Nicholas, but he is likely to meet with obstacles on
his march, as the Cirgassians have occupied all the de-
files., and seem resolved to make the most desperate re-
sistance. The 14th division and the rest of ahe 15th
division of the five corps go by land to Georgia to
take up a position on the river Terek. One division
of the third corps has already arrived in Bessarabia,
and a second is marching to the Crimea to continue
the stili uafinished works of Sebastopol.

Liberator of Ireland ; but who merits the higher title
of the Liberator and the Friend of Man.
Generous Sir, you will weep-angels might weep, at
the intrusion of sectarian feelingF.), to sully the great
cause in whi,h we are now engaged.• It must be sup
pressed-- it must be exterminated. The services you
have rendered to humanity ; the increasing popularity
which attends on your voice and your steps, as you be-
come every day better known, and more justly appre-
ciated by the people of England, gives you a power for
good greater than I have ever known to be possessed
by any other man. That power I am sure will be ex-

Mr. Ji:sErti conceived that it was quite'time "enough
fir the Vestry to adopt that course when-they received
notice of the issue of the proceedings arising from the in-

been reecived• from the solicitor upon the subject.
The CHAIRMAN replied in the, negative, and after
some further dismission 'between ' Messrs. Hovenden,

Me. FLOOD, the Vestry Clerk, opened the business
of the day by reading the balance sheet,-. showing the

The CHAIBbIAN said that the time had now. arrived
when, as one 'of the defendhots agninst whom the
action had been brought • in ' the Vice-Chaneellu'ee
Court, and against whom also the execution fe' county-
rate bad been issued, he hit it his duty to say 56:11e
thing upon the anetter.—(Hear, hear.) In the
first place he begged .distinctly to contradict the
statements in the 'newsPapers-7etbae he had en-
deavoured to shift the burden of the' crourity-
. rate on to Lord Kenyoo's shoulders, upnn the plea
that he (the Chairman) was the junior chureliWarden.
Such was not the fact ; he denied that he held any-ine
ferior station to the Noble Lord-when he was elected
by that Vestry, the representative of 150,000
( Hear, hear.) The plea upon which he really had ob-
jected was, that Lord Kenyon, having smiled upon a
most dishonest chancery suit; have the evilsa e-
suiting therefrom made to recoil upon- hie own head,
which had been the' ease.—(Cheers') the Chairalao
here went on to detail the -proceediegi•which had htin
triken iu refereace to placing the exeeutiou for county-
rate in 116 house, and stated 'that wh6n Mr. Alien, the
treasurer of the Magistrates, came ore Monthly morning
last, that gentleman had admitted, in the p:esence of
Mr. Lowe, a vestryinena dint. he should not.have taken
such a step had it not been,th.e wish of Lord Kenyon.
—(Cries of " Shame): Mr. Hall, the Magistrate
who signed the wa, rant, had subsequently oleo admitted
that it was at the wish of Lord Kenyon he had done so.
—(Shame, shame.) On. leaving the Vestry on Satur-
day last he bad felt it.nis duty to apprise the Noble
Lord of what had transpired there, - The offer he had
made tor the purpose of -rescuing the' parish from 'diffi-
culty had lead to a correspondence, which he would
now read. [The Chairman here read a' letter
expressive - of his reisdieess to Pev one-half the
demand for county-rant if the Noble , Lord would
pay- the -other half, which he had addressed- to
his Lordship.] - He (the chairman) deeply regretted
he did not. see-. the Noble Lord in his place in the

After receiving this, on Saturday evening fast, hr
•(the chairman) waited upon .his Lordship in Portnitin
square. He explained to his Lordship, that in the
impression .he lid formed of the Vestry, he ccirsi-
dered ;he was labouring under a mistake,, to which
Lord Kenyon replied, " Sir, please to allow me my
own opinion." He (the chairman) then drew les
Lordship's attention to the Chancery. suit, mere p.ar
ticularly to that most dishonest portion of it which
sought to restrain the Vestry from paying to the bank
ors ajust debt ; to which Lord Kenyon-replied," That
he did not thick it waS2di'shonest .; and that if the
bankers would lend motley - to men who had
not a. shilling, they must take the cons(-

moral feeling of the . England
that the judgment of the Vice-Chance.- dee.
had gone against them, but the high standing ...ti
meter of the Vestry was unimpeached.—( Hear, hear.;
In recording his judgment, the following were the
words used by that high functionary iu reference to.
the conduct of the Vestry. [The Chairman here real
the following extract from the judgment of the Vice-.
Chancellor : " In the first place, 1 must say that I do
net think myself that any case has been made out
against the vestrymen who have been made defendants,
or the body of the vestrymen generaliy, which at all
affects their moral character.---(Hear, hear.) Nothing
which appears on these affidavits at all induces me to
think they have odd with any motive which has any
sort of corruption in it whatever, and I must say, when.
I read the statement in the affidavits made by Mr.
Daheyne and MI% Pope, it rather appeared to me to be
made under an excess of feeling than from any very co.'
gent appearance of truth in its favour; it rather appeared
to me the thing in some degree contradicted itself; for I
could not understand bow any persons could enter into a
scheme for acquiring fraudulently credit, influence, and
popularity in the pariah, by means of which they prumete
their own private interests, when the course they were
pursuing was tars, to allow a debt to be incurred, and
then pay off that debt by borrowing."! - This, then, he
would say, that, even upon the authority of the Vice-
Chancellor of England, the high character and credit of
that Vestry was unimpeached that the foul and calum-
nious charges of jobbing and extravangance had fallen to
the ground, and that it was solely from base rancour,
malice,and disappointment, that, their enemies had been
induced to lose sight of even'that greatest of obligations,
the sacredness of an oath.—(Cheers.)
Mr. COcEa.'.N said, as Lord Kenyon had been
pleased to cast such an imputation on the Vestry, it was
but just he should suffer.: however, for the credit ol.the..
perish he would move that the amount of counts-rate •
be paid that day fortnight. . •
This having been seconded, was at once carried,•wlreb'
Nk. FLOOD read a notice which had been served of
him by Lord Kenyou's solicitors, Messrs. Milne, Parry;
Milne, and Morris, giving the Vestry, the treasurers,_
their solicitors,-and the rate-pay ers notice, that he should
resist any attempt to enforce from hint, as ChurchVvai;
don, the sum required of the parish for county-rate, and
hold them responsible,
.and compel them to reimburse
him for any loss or &nine be might sustain.
Mr. THEOBALD moved that the notice be entered oil.
the minutes ; as a matter of course the Vestry were in
duty bound to Mikis-reify Lord Kenyon.
Mr. GRANGE having seconded the motion,
Mr. KENSETT moved .as an amendment that the no-
tice lie on the table..
Mr. SODEN seconded the amendment, and argued
that, after the gross insult the Vestry had received at
Lord Kenyon's hands, they would show themselves not
without spirit. •
Mr. KENSETT considered that Lord Kenyon bad
been prominent in casting disrespect on the Vestry end
breeding an ill feeling throughout the parish ; under
these circumstances the Vestry ought to treat him in
a similar. manner.
The Rev. Dr. DIBDIN and Mr. SKINNER argued in
favour of the proposition.

to he true in any degree t'-rat. iat cleaulines will not obvi.ite.
The Chairman had his programme of speakers, but
the call was loud for Mr. GAIMISON, who, after a little
Mounted the table, declaring, that it he spoke at
ail, lie would speak out. From his remarks I soon
hued nut why a published report would not be aceep-
_teble. It appears, Sir, that among the Deputies Item
Ike-ler:el are several
,female Friends, distinguished for
ecel and eloquence, who represent the Female Abolition
Society ; and, to my utter astonishment, I find that the
'Deputice•of this country, a majority of whom are also
!Friends; one of whose distinguishing tenets is, that they
epeuk under the dictates of the Holy Spirit, which, like
the wind, " hloweth where it listeth"—these then have,
~by- dint of numbers in the Convention, resolved that
no 'woman shall be a Member of it. I asked a talented
American Friend in the room, what
.could be the mo-
tive of this unmannerly insult put -upon ladies and
;foreigners, visiting our shores for so holy and benevo-
lent a purpose. " Friend," said he, " it is bigotry
at d priestcraft ; Mrs. Alicia Mott is a member of the
...11iekaite Seceders from the American Society of Friends ;
a community who think themselves led by the Spirit
into views of religion less consistent with what is called
cithodoxy than the old Society ; this is the head and
front of her offending.' " The Friend who said this,
told me et the same time, that he is himself in doctrine
at the very antipodes of Mrs. Mott, but that he knows'
1: er genuine worth, and cannot endure that she should be
insutted. For this, Sir, are the laws of British hospita-
lity violated,-and the British public deprived of an ex-
: mple, than which nothing could be more calculated to
improve our minds and manners, by affording a true
illustration of the axiom of the Apostle, that " in Christ
Jesus
,there is neither male nor female." 0 wretched
biindness and folly ! ! 1 Sir, we have heard much of the
persecuting propensities of the Church of Rome.—
much, I am persuaded, that is not only exaggerated,
but false ; but I have never heard of its perpe-
trating absurdity like- this. Indeed, I am convinced
that it is from distinguished minds in the Catholic
communion, that we are ultimately to learn the true
principles of mental hospitality.
Mr. GARRISON revealed this circumstance to the
meeting, and said, without reserve, that had such a re-
ception. been -expected, no deputation, either ma:t or
female, would have crossed the Atlantic on this occa-
sion ; and that indignation at this exclusion had pre-
vented 'fen front taking part in the proceedings at
'Exeter Hall. Mr. Garrison speaks with clearness
:and energy, but I think may learn something of
true natural oratory, by his visit to England, which he
would hardly acquire in the midst of the wild and
wordy bombast-4f his countrymen. He complained
that the. religious missionaries who bad visited the
Stafei had kept entirely aloof from the Aboli-
Mr. Garrison attempted to point out some

P.S.—Since the ablate was Wrilin;.! have learned
by painful expeqence, that although there is undoubt-

there is also much bigotry and uncharitableness. I
called on Mr. Seeley, bookseller, of Fleet•street, to
ask him to sell the Report which 1 hate published of

Young Mr. Seeley said he knew not who the Abori-

were the movieg parties ? I mentioned Mr. Buxton,
Mr. Mackinnon: Mr. Evans, and others, until I came
to the name of Dr. Bowring, the first sound of which
was quite enough. He instantly said, "0, Sir, we
can have nothing to do with the matter—we beg you

of character and sentiment in. the ren'owned Beaty w•

only within the lath week that the moos of the Monate

argans of the-Tory faction : for a faction it is; so far, at
!f-ast, as regards the opposition of its members to the cdu
cation of the Irish people, and by no other Lame can
it. The Dublin Evening Midi has had the can•
flour to proclaim this holy alliance, and to extend the right

which is now dr wning upon the long-enslaved peasantry of

Irish, is now hurried off to his grave in the flower of Man-.
hood. The head-quarters of the 18th embark on board.

MAY 20.—Accounts irom',Khivii continue to be ttees►
tain and contradictory. • The folloWing is eztrac ed from
letter, dated Candahar, April 16
" We have late news from Herat ; things are not,going
on there much to the credit of the British character. &cry •
native who comes thence declares that the Vuzeer Yes
Mahomed looks upin the mission with contempt, and says
Todd is a mere English Buneah sent to. supply him_witk
money. As long as they c.n milk the cow, things may
appear quiet, but in reality there is aio im[rovernent it the
country. Yar Mahornedi it is said," h4s already sold or,
swapped for horses 30,000 of the inh4bitants of the valley of
Herat. His son is now on a preteqed mission to Persia, but
it is supposed in reality he has pine to meet the Russians at
Khiva, to whom he will sell the city as soon as he English
have put it in repair, and it will bring a good price. The
natives cannot conceive a stronger power will come down
with money to a weaker, so they attribute all our outlay
at Herat to fear of Russia and Persia. The Khlvans have
got defeated by tt,e Russians ; they met them on an opei
plain, when the Russian horse artillery soon astonished
their weak minds. ' They witl of course keep Kliiv& per-
manently, and next throw out their feelers to Bukhara and

Ongune. Captain Abbott was looked upon as-a spy at
Kinva, seeing he had no money nor credentials, and he it;
colifioed to his house. As for trade, I fear it wilt soon be
over done ; the place is full of picoe goods, and no out.

The following n:.•lancholy intelligence of ate hardships
su-tained in the Belloochi terri!ory has 1114 reached us by
a private letter fr. mil Sukitqr, dated the 29.,h of April.- The
bardiliips of the deserts, where water proves deficient, ter.
rilale to the natives themselves, occasion an aniount of suf-
fering, which it is frightful to contemplate to those accusf
turned to a cool and humid climate :—.

" Yesterday an official arrived, stating that Lieutenants
Ckrk anc Vernon, with a party of horse, went in pursuit
of lame ilellociehees, but arrived too late. In returning
they lest their way in the- desert, and after wandering
about all day in the intense bat, at last found the_road.
Lieutenant Vernon was brought in delirious ; twenty-eight
wen dropped in the desert,. and those that came in with
great difficulty saved their lives. As soon as the horses
smelt the water, which was only a small muddy pool; they
became quite m..d and rushed into it, and both men end
beasts eagerly drank mud; this was near Pultsjee, wheri?
the beat is truly awful. It is almost d'tath to ne out."
DELHI.—The grand convoy got safely through the, pegs
without the least molevation ; and we have let!..ers frost
suite officers of the returning troops, who espec,,to. to
;each Jellilalabad on the 10th instant. It teems the 48th
Jed the way, and the 37th Native Infintr brought up the

a favourable eflct, as not a K)burie showed himself. 'lt

LONDON, MAY iSo4.

We learn from the Letter of cur Correspondent
at Dover, that Sir SIDNEY SMITH has had an Aaion
with several of the Enemy's Gun-brigs. it appears
that they were rash enough to venture out to attack
him, but after a few broadsides from the Anteke,
they fled 4.! every diredion : One was taken, seven
sunk, acid a great number driven on shore; and
they would probably have been all destroyed, if
the shallowness of the Coast had not prevented our
vessels from following them.

rs.TERDAy •Paris Papers were received to the
lath inst, inclusive. The plan for making BONA.
rARTE Ei.7joes-or of the French is very nearly com.
pleted. The Senate has presented an Address to the
First Consul, in which they take great pains to
convince him that the safety of France, and the hap.
pinebs of Europe, depe,ol entirely upon his acceptance
of the title of of the French, and upon its be-
ing made hereditary in his illustrious family. They
talk, however, of the necessity of adopting some
ftr asures fur the purpose of guaranteeing the rights
Of the Nation, by securing the Freedom of 'the
Press, and of Elections, and also establishing the
responsibility of the Ministers. This kind of lan-
guage is undoubtedly very absurd, considering the
state of abjea slavery in which the people of France
are at present; it was, however, we suppose, the
language they were ordered to make use of ; but it was
a most cruel insult to the People of France tomake their
Legislature talk of Freedom and of Rights, at the
very m.iment when they are proclaiming themselves
the Slaves of a Foreign Usurper. The different
divisions of the Army are of course sending Ad.

Two Hamburgb mails have arrived since ear
last, and Dutch Papers to the r7th inst.

It is reported in a letter from Constantinop/e, that
the English had effe6led a landing in Egypt, and
taken Alexandria. This, however, we have little
hesitation in pronouncing to be untrue. The re.
port of the French Toulon Fleet having sailed, is
renewed. A more probable statement is, that a
part of Lord NELSON'S Squadron had sailed to Al-
giers, to chastize the insolence of the DE t.
Accounts from Peter...burgh confirm what we be_
fore stated, that the EMP ER ort had ordered a Court
Mourning on account of the Death of the Duke d'Etsr.
GHIEN. The Court of Sweden had also gone into
Mourning on the same account, for eight days.
The family of Mr. DRAKE passed through Land.
shut, on their way to England, on the z tst
In consequence of the elevation of his Master, the
French Ambassador at the Hague has mounted the
Imperial Eagle.
Accounts from the Cape of Good Hope, express
a belief that the. Squadrons of IA NOIS and HART.
SINK have formed a junction, and are gone on an
expedition against Colon.

Saturday morning, about twelve o'clock, His
MAJESTY, accompanied by the DUKE of CAM.
BRIDGE, in his post chariot, and followed by the
QUEEN and PRINCESSES, took an airing through
several of the principal streets in London, and by
Hampstead.
At three o'clock His MAJESTY gave audiences
to the Earls UXBRIDGE .and WINCH LSE A, Lords
HAWKESBURY and RIVERS, and the latter Noble-
man had the honour to kiss His MAJESTY'S hand on
his being appointed a Lord of the Bedchamber, in
the room of the Earl WINCHILsr.A.
Yesterday morning, about eleven o'clock, the
LORD CHANCELLOR and Mr. PITT had an audience
Of HIS MAJESTY.

Yesterday, about tweltrs o'clock, HIS MAJESTY,
accompanied by the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE, and fol-
lowed by the QUEEN, PRINCESSES, and the DUKES
of CUMBERLAND and KENT, took an airing to Kew.
Saturday the DUKES of YORK, CUMBERLAND,
KENT, and CAMBRIDGE, dined With HER; MAJESTY.

The Cabinet Council which was to have been held
on Saturday, at Lord HARROW BY'S Office, in Down-
ing-street, was deferred till yesterday, when Mr.
PITT, Lord MELY/LLE, Lord HARROWBY) and
Earl CAMDEN, were present.
The Earl Of CHESTERFIELD iS tO receive the va.
cant Blue Ribband, and resign his situation of Mas.
ter of the Horse, very much to the regret of those
persons who were under his Lordship in that de.
partment.
Mr. CANNING, as Treasurer of the Navy, has
reinstated Mr. TROTTER in the office of Comptrol-
ler of the Navy.
The Anniversary of Mr. PITT'S Birth-day re-
turns on the 28th instant, and we doubt not than
it will prove a day of festivity to the friends of
MONARCHY AND THE CONSTITUTION.

The Son of Lord CHARLES SOMERSET is appointed
Page of Honour to His MAJESTY, in the -room of
the Hon. E. M. IRBY, appointed an Ensign in the
33 Regiment of Guards.
The PRINCE of WALES gave his second Grand
Dinner on Saturday last at Carleton House. The
Company was about as numerous as before. The
PRINCE very naturally conceives, that it is neees.
sary for him to become more intimately acquainted
with the rank, property, and talents of the Country ;
and, notwithstanding all the insinuations of the
Anti-Prerogative Prints, will keep up the dignity
of the Heir-Apparent, without any alloy of Party, in
his weekly entertainments.

Some of the Morning Prints, for want of politi-
cal intelligence, are obliged to have recourse to the
old expedient of fabrication. Hence the Public are
every day amused with accounts of new obstacles in
the way of Mr. PITT, which, we are happy to say,
are only to be found in the columns of a Newspaper.
Of this kind, we have reason to believe; is a story
about the dismission of Lord AMHERST as one of
the Lords of the Bedchamber, and Mr. PITT'S con-
sequent resolution to resign. There is another story
of equal authority, stating Mr. PITT'S having ex.
expressed doubts to His MAJESTY, whether he
could " condua the Public Business under an exclu-
sion of talents ;" and that the answer was, " At
least, Mr. PITT, you can try." If there were
any foundation for the latter story, it must have
been heard by " a rat behind the arras ;" but as
there was no exclusion of talents in general, and
merely an exception to t'ne employment of Mr. Fox
in a Cabinet situation, the whole may be considered
as a silly go:lipping invention.
Thursday the General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland met at Edinburgh. His Grace FRANCIS
Lord NAPIER; His Majesty's High Commis-
sioner, attended by His Grace the Duke of Buc-
CLEUGH, the Earls of DALKEITH, ERROL, MORAY,
DALHOUSIE, and MOIRA, Viscounts ARBUTHNOT;

and RANCLIFFE, Sir JAMES ST. CLAIR ERSKINE,
Sir JOHN DALRYMPLE, Sir JAMES DUNBAR, Lieu.

a greater attendance of Gentlemen of Distir.stion,
and Military Officers, , thin was ever witnessed on
any former occasion, walked in procession (a de..
tachment of the Inverness.shire Militia and the
City Guard lining the streets) from his lodgings, in
the King's arms Tavern; to the High Church,
where be was received by the Magistrates in their
robes.

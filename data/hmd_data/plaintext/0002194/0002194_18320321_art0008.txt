AN IMPROMPTU
UPON PASSING THE STATUE OP MR. PITT IN HANOVER-SQUARE•

Think not this pond'rous, huge, misshapen mas,,
Betrays a nation's skill employed in vain;
A Tory faction rears the pile--alas I
Type of a bigot King's disastrous reign.

Ye Tory minions of an age gone by,
Bow to your Dagon as ye hither wend ;
Worship the Idol of your slavery—
We hail the Statesman who is freedom's friend. W.

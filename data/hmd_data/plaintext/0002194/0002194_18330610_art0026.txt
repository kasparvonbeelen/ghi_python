KENT.—_IMPORTANT FREEHOLD ESTATE.
THE FREEHOLD and MANOR of
SWANSCOMBE, with all its rights, privileges,
and appurtenances, most delightfully situate at Swans-
combe, near Gravesend, and extending downwards to the
south bank of the river Thames, with the high road to
Dover and Paris running through the Estate, will be sold
by auction, in 23 Lots, by Mr. Adam Murray, at Garra-
way's Coffee-house, on Monday, the Ist of July next.
This Estate contains I,OIOA. 2a. 12r., and is divided
into Lots for the convenience of Purchasers. No situa-
tion can be more picturesque and enchanting, combining
rich woodland, water, and distant scenery, probably un-
rivalled in the whole county of Kent. It is an interesting
spot, independently of the beauty of its situation being
rich i n many of the brightest events in the history of our
native country. A man of taste may here enjoy the rational
and invigorating pleasures of rural retirement, or recreate
himself from the fatigues of business, while the short dis-
tance from London (only 18 miles), and the facility of
conveyance, both by laud and water, afford ample oppor-
tunity of partaking, at pleasure, of the diversions and
amusements of the metropolis. It is presumed that this
delightful, undulating, and commanding situation, em-
bracing alike extensive prospects of a beautiful country,
and the heart•stirring scene of innumerable shipping,
bearing their treasures from all parts of the world to the
port of London, added to the short distance from the ca-
pital, will render many of the allotments eminently de-
sirable for the erection of Villas, Cottages, Ornees, and
other Country Residences. The property includes rich
and productive Arable, Pasture, Meadow, Marsh, and
Woodlands, Chalk-works, Rail-road, and Shipping-wharf
on the Thames,—Houses, Gardens, Cottages, &c.
Particulars and Specifications may he had (after the
15th of June) of Mr. Adam Murray, 61, St. Martin's-
lane; R. Bignell, Esq., 5, Alfred-place, Bedford-square;
Messrs. Tennant, Harrison, and Tennant, Gray's Inn ;
and at Garraway's Coffee-house, Change-alley, Cornhill.

and other foreign papers; They are marked
by a spirit of reserve and forbearance toward,
all parties, very much at variance with
the usual braggadocio character of a Turkish
address or manifesto. The only sentence which
at all conveys anything like an expression of
feeling or opinion, is that where the great Con.
tinental Powers are alluded to. During the
progress of the Egyptian quarrel, " those Ca-
binets," says the Moniteur Ottoman, " which
are especially considered to be the representa-
tives of the progress of civilization, remained
wholly indifferent, because they were engaged
in affairs which they probably considered to be
more important. At that time, energetic lan-
guage would have commanded general tran-
quillity ; now, recourse must be had to fleets
and armies, and to all the military display
which is never without prejudice to the protector
as well as the protected, and often puts to greater
hazard the peace which it is intended to insure."
This last sentence would seem to bear a direct
allusion to Russia; and if so, it is manifest that
the Porte is just beginning to feel uneasiness
as to the probable result of such inauspicious
patronage. But its distrust, however wholesome
and expedient, will avail little in finally warding
off, though it may for a brief season, protract,
the evil hour of Russian domination, Peace
being once effectually secured between the
Porte and MEHEMET ALI, it will be
NICHOLAS'S turn next to commence liti-
gation. He will take up the position which
the Egyptian has just abandoned ;—that is to
say, he will become a suitor for justice at the
hands of the Porte, backed by a powerful army
to give weight to his demands. He will claim
compensation for the expenses to which he has
been put by his recent interference, and
knowing well that the Porte cannot satisfy
him, will most probably content himself
with pocketing another province or two by
way of equivalent, and in corroboration of
his claims to superior liberality and disin-
terestedness. The conduct of Russia from
the commencement of the Egyptian struggle
(which it had long foreseen and provided for,
possibly by an indirect encouragement of IBRA-
HIM) has been marked by consummate skill and
duplicity. In all the arts of diplomatic finesse,
her Cabinet is a match for combined Europe.
Were her strength in the field but equal to her
cunning in the closet, she would soon see the
whole continent at her feet. Till the Russian
bear is muzzled, and the monster's paws lashed
fast behind his back, there can be no hope of
permanent peace for Europe. The St. Peters-
burgh Cabinet is the last strong-hold of des-
potism and bigotry.

It has been stated that the Tories in the
House of Lords reckoned on a majority of more
than 30 against the Irish Church Reform Bill.
This was the fact, but it is stated to-day by the
friends of Ministers, with great confidence, that
the reproof which the Tories have met with on
the Portuguese question has cooled the courage
of that party, and that, being now fully aware
of the consequences which might result from
the rejection of the Irish Church Reform Bill,
they do not intend to offer any decided oppo-
sition to that measure. All those persons who
do not desire the extinction of the power of
the House of Peers as a third branch of the
Legislature, will be glad to see this statement
confirmed. Even the force of habit, which has
so long reconciled the people of this country to
the domination of the hereditary Aristocracy,
would be insufficient to prevent the effect of the
suicidal blow which the House of Peers
would inflict upon itself, were it to re-
ject the only remedial measure which has
been introduced by the reformed House of
Commons in favour of a country in which all
the constitutional rights of the people have
been, for a time, at least, prostrated, in order
to gratify the Conservatives. For our own
part, although there may be reason to regret
that a return to reason may prevent the
necessity of immediately adopting measures
which would place the House of Peers on a
more constitutional footing, we cannot but con-
gratulate the Tory Aristocracy on the conviction
which they are said to have acquired, of the
importance of acting more in consonance with the
wishes of the people than they have hitherto done.
It seems that the Bishops bad taken alarm ,and that
out of consideration to them, the Wellington
party mean to refrain from any act of open de-
fiance ; but it does not require any extraordinary
powers of foresight to predict that, although
the Bishops may go through the year 1833 as
legislators, they will have to struggle hard in
the next year for the retention of a character so
opposed to the intentions of their divine office,
and so incompatible, as experience has shown,
with the true interests of the country.

There have been several meetings of the
leaders of the Anti-Slavery party in the House
of Commons during the last week ; and, we
understand, that they consider themselves suffi-
ciently strong to interpose material obstacles to
the Government measure for the abolition of
slavery. Ministers do not expect to carry the
12 years' clause without serious opposition.

The arrivals last week were moderate of all descriptions of
Grain ; and the return of Flour was scanty. The trade
throughout manifested some indications of improvement. This
morning the fresh arrivals are not considerable, and there
is a good attendance of buyers in the market. All the fine
dry samples of Wheat were readily taken off at full ls. to 28.
per quarter advance upon last terms, but the trade for all other
sorts has not improved. Barley for grinding free sale
and Is. to 2s. per quarter dearer. Beans that are dry are in
ready demand, and full 2s. ,per quarter advance has been ob-
tained. Pease of both kinds are scarce, but there is little de-
mand for them, as considerably higher prices are asked. Oats
arrive in moderate quantities, and for all kinds Is. per quarter
advance has been obtained. Fresh made Flour is in good re-
quest at last week's prices.

port of the petition. He said, that during the short time he
had sat in that House, he had seen a wonderful disinclination
on the part of those who imposed taxes to take them off again.
Mr. CALCRAFT rose to present a petition from the wail
silk mercers of Westminster, complaining, that by a construc-
tion which was put by the Commissioners of Customs upon
the Treasury resolution of the Ilth of March, respecting the
drawback upon silk, they were deprived of the benefit intended
for the trade by that resolution. They had a large stock, ow
hand, in pieces of 170 and 180 yards, and it was the prattice
for the trade to cut off what was called the fag-end, td send
round as patterns to customers ; in consequence of which the
Commissioners decided that such pieces were not " uncut,'.,'--
a word which they added to theresolution of the 11th of March.
Surely these retail traders were intended to he included in the
arrangement provided by the resolution of the House. The
riband weavers of Coventry were more fortunate, through the
zeal and skill of their Hon. Member, for they had succeeded
in getting the drawback of twopence a yard upon their pieces,
not worth more than three shillings. He really hoped that the
hardship of these retail silk-mercers would be considered by
the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
The CHANCELLOR. of the EXCHEQUER hoped that
the discussion of this measure would be reserved for the Com-
mittee, when details could be best considered.--( II ear !)
Mr. HOBHOUSE said, that though friendly to the prin-
ciple of the proposed measure, he hoped the application of the
Petitioners would be fully and maturely considered. They
wanted nothing but fairness, and a due consideration of their
complaints.
The petition was brought up, and laid on the table.
Lord CLIFTON presented a petition from Gravesend against
slavery.
Mr. LENNARD presented a petition from Ely, against the
licenced victuallers' dutis. _

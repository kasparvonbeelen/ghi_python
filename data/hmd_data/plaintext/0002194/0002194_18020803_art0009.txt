EXTRACT OF A T,ETTER FROM GIBRALTAR, JUNE 24.
Sir ROBERT BARLOW, in the Tripyob of
74 guns, and a Frigate, have sailed for Algiers,
in consequence of the Algerines detaining three
English vessels, on 4cco4nt of their having either
false Mediterranean Passes, or old ones that had
been used for other vessels; they have condemned
the vessels and cargoes, .and sold them.—We ex-
peet Sir RotERT will only demand the men from
slavery. The Algerines sent a frigate and two
zebecks down to the back of the rock, with the
intention of taking a Portuguese line of battle
ship and a frigate that cruises in tht. Gut ; they
islet with only the frigate within our sight, which
the two zebecks boarded and carried into Algiers,
after murdering nearly all on board. We expect
they will take more of them soon.
" The Emperor of MOROCCO has demanded from
.the Swedish and American Consuls, residing' at.
Tangiers, to' order their cruisers to permit his
ending corn collie Port of Tunis, which is block-
aded by them ; Captain TauxToN, the American
Commander here, said his particular orders were,
not to comply with any such
,request ; in conse.
quence of this answer, the Emperor has ordered
the Consuls to quit his dominions ; an American
frigate has sailed to take Mr. JAMES S!MrsoN, the
American Consul, and his family on hoard, and is
expeCted here every hour. It is expeCted the Moors
will send out small cruisers against the Americans
immediately. •
" The 4:qerb, of 74 guns, and the Dragon, are
the only ships remaining here."

State of the Poll for Carmarthen on Friday
Mr. HAMLYN WILLIAMS - 124
Mr. PAXTON - 1176
At the close of the Poll in Dublin on. Thursday
last, the numbers were,
For John Claudius Beresford, Esq. • logs
john Larouche, Esq. - -99 z
ight Hon. George Ogle, -
Jonah Barrington, Esq. • - 7 513
A very curious circumstance happened at the
Eledion for Coventry. Qn.the first day Messrs.
JEF.FERI's and BAR Low, polled two voters (If the
name of Jefferys and Barlow, and two of the names
of the ynfortunate Candidates, Messrs. • BIRD and

MOORE.
The Dinner at the Crown and Anchor on Thurs:
day, was in the true Republican style—Ca Ira and
the Morsellois Hymn were sung—One unfortunate
man who had a clean shirt and,a whole coat on, was
of course suspeaed of Loyalty, and, being formally
denounced, was expelled.
The columns of the Morning Chronicle were never
so disgraced in argument, as by the Letter signed
Brutus, which appeared in that Paper of Saturday
last.

The Chronicle of yesterday makes a most in-
vnious attack upon 'Mr. MAINWARING, because a
man of nearly the same name was accused in the
reign of CHARLES I. of 'entertaining too nigh no.
tions of the Royal Prerogative. We do not exactly
see the justice of this mode of attacking a man,
because another of 'a similar name may have been
guilty.—We might as well accuse Sir FRANCIS
BURDETT JONES of Sedition, because Mr. 3. C.
Jones was tried for that offence, or attack the
liimaarahlt Mr. C. Vox, because Mr. Charles Fox
was conviaed at the Canterbury' Ass4.es of uttering
.4'editicvss expression.

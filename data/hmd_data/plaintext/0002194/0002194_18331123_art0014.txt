As a proof
of the extent to which the expor-
tation of bullion is at present going on, it may be men.
tioned that one vessel alone in the course of last week
conveyed to Calais 40,000 ounces of gold and 277,000
ounces of silver. The operation is considered to be a
prdcautionary one, entered iuto to prevent the threatened
decline of the exchanges.

PARNELL, M.P.

After the customary local toasts had been drunk, Provost
Kay, who occupied the chair, proposed the health of their
guest, on whose Parliamentary labours he passed a warm
and deserved eulogy.
The toast was drank amidst rapturous applause for a
considerable time.
Sir HENRY rose, and was received with enthusiastic
cheering. He proceeded to thank them in general terms
fir this flattering mark of their regard, and then spoke as
follows :—Provost and Gentlemen,—Having come amongst
you after a laborious session, it is right that I should give
you an account of my conduct as your representative in
Parliament. It is the duty of every Member readily and
willingly to stand before Iris constituents, to tell what he
has done, as well as to hear what they have to say in ap-
proval or condemnation of his conduct.—(Cheers.) First,
with regard to his Majesty's Ministers. I thought it was
proper to place confidence in them, as possessing every
disposition to conduct the business of the country on
liberal principles, after having carried Reform in Parliament.
I therefore went on the principle of giving them a general
support; but I reserved the right of differing from them
wh n I thought proper, and of maintaining those prin-
ciples I have always advocated with that courage,
consistency, and firmness which became your reoresenta-
tive.—(Great cheering.) But, although I gave them a
general support, you will find that I voted against several
of their measures. lam aware thateMinisters had great
difficulties to encounter; but, in my opinion, and in the
opinion of many others well able to judge, had Ministers
acted with snore courage they would have managed matters
with more success, and with greater satisfaction to them-
e, Ives, and advantage to the public..—(Cheers.) I think
they gave way too much to the apprehension of opposition
in the House of Lords. I think they should have looked
to the House of Lot ds as possessing a power which would
not be submitted to in this country (Immense cheering.)
If they had felt that the people would never suffer theni-
selv, s to ire governed by the Home of Lords, they might
in the end have secured the passing of their measures by
the support of public opinion ; and they might have
brought the House of Lords to give way to what was the
prevailing wish of the country.—(Great cheering.)—
[After a few words of explanation, accounting for the
p !unity of times that he had spoken during the session, Sii
Henry proceeded.3—Gentlemen, before I had the honour of
representing you in Parliament part of the session had
passed away—the question as to the Irish Coercion Bill had
been carried, and the budget had been agreed to. I certainly
do still think, as I stated to you on a former occasion,
that the Government made a great mistake in regard to
Ireland in passing so strong a measure as the Coercion
Bill ; and the more I have looked into the question, the
more convinced I feel, that, had the suggestions I made as
chairman of a Committee in 1832, appointed to inquire
into the state of Ireland, been attended to, they would
have found means specified much more likely to trans
quilling, and ultimately to lead to a permanent settlement
of the difficulties connected with that country. With re-
gard to the Irish Church Bill, I consider it a very valua-
hie measure. The abolition of no less than ten bishop-
rics was certainly a large step towards church reform ;
but I consider that the concession made to the House of
Lords in regard to the 147th clause was extremely ob-
jectionable, as altering in a great degree the efficiency
of the measure. I voted against the alteration of the
147th clause, the object of which was to declare that the
surplus revenues of the church might be applied to tem-
poral purposes.—(Cheers.) As the case of Ireland is
one of great interest, I will make an observation as to
tithes, because Ireland will never be in a settled condi-
tion till this point is settled. But, unfortunately, the
attempt to settle this question has been postponed,
and nothing like a large and extensive measure
has been entered upon with the view of set-
tling this difficult and engrossing question. In 1831 the
subject was proposed in the King's speech ; in 1832,
Committees were appointed, and a Bill to collect and secure
the arrears of tithes under which several thousand prose-
cutions took place at an expense of 50,0001., and with the
result of receiving 12,000/.—(Great 'aughter.) The
session of 1833 passed without the subject being adverted
to, till towards the close we were called upon to vote one
million as a loan to the Irish clergy, to make up, in the
meantime for the bygone arrears of tithes. On that oc-
casion, I saw nothing like security for payment of the
loan, and accordingly I voted against the granting of it.—
(Cheers.) The first question of importance which oc-
curred after I had taken my seat was the question as to
the currency, brought forward by Mr. Attwood. 1
entirely disapproved of Mr. Attwood's views on the cur-
rency question, and accordingly spoke and voted against
him ; and I am glad to think that the alterations sug-
gested by him were not adopted ; but at the same time 1
thought that Government went too far in opposing all
inquiry as to the state of the nation ; anti, in my speech
on that occasion, I advised Government to have Corn
mittees of inquiry. I was happy to see that next day
Lord Althorp adopted my suggestion, and proposed
the Committees which have done so much good, and
dispelled many of the apprehensions which existed as to
our future prosperity. With regard to the army esti
mates 1 felt that I could not agree to them as propos-d
and printed ; and, in consequence of that being my opi-
nion, the matter was submitted to a Committee—a measure
which I agreed to in preference to opposing the estimates
in the House, believing that it would end in making some
considerable reductions. Here, however, I have been
disappointed—a majority of the Committee not being dia.
posed to manage matters with sufficient economy. There
was a considerable division of opinion in the Committee,
and on several questions I was in the minority, so that I
am not responsible for its report.—(Cheers.) [Sir Henry
then alluded to some observations made at the late dinner
given to him and his colleague by the Lord Advocate, and
proceeded.' On the subject of military establishments,
the question arose as to the number of men which should
be kept up. I proposed a reduction of 10,000 men,
and I specified tie manner in which this could be ac-
cotnplished ; namely, by not filling up the vacancies
which occurred by death or otherwise. It is calcu
lated that, in the course of a year, eleven thousand of
our army are reduced by casualties ; and from this
cause alone the reduction I proposed would be ac-
complished, assisted, as it might be, by accepting
of discharges. In this way the dead weight of pen-
sions would be avoided. (Loud cheering.) Mr.
Hume proposed a reduction of 20,000 men ; but as every
soldier is entitled by Act of Parliament to have a pension,
such an extensive and immediate reduction would have
entailed a chat ge of from 200,000/. to 300,0001. a year
for pensions. I accordingly opposed Mr. Hume on this
occasion, because the same reduction might have been
brought about by my plan without increasing the dead
weight.—(Cheers.) Sir Henry then adverted to the
subject of colonial slavery, and came to the subject of
the public expenditure, on which be said that the Go
vernment have certainly a claim of credit on the country
for having accomplished considerable reductions. But,
the items are examined, it will he found that no reduc-
tion in that par: alluded to by the Provost has been made.
The military establishments of the country are as high as
ever. In my opinion there is touch room for reduction,
and, if the representatives do their duty, they will not
allow the next session to pass without causing these
reductions to be made.—(Cheers.) On the subject of
taxation, I beg leave to state that, seeing in certain part,.
of the country so much done to compel reduction of
particular taxes, it is necessary to inquire where reductions
can be made in the expenditure so as to admit of such taxes
being repealed. lam sure nobody would like to see the
national credit endangered, the dividends unpaid, or
provision want'ng for necessary expensed ; but if there be
means of reducing taxis, the question is, what are the taxes
which should be reduced, au that the interests of the coun-
try may be best promoted by such reduction ? No one
will deny that those taxes should be reduced first which
interfere with the productions of industry, in the shape
of taxes on raw material, thus diminishing the remunera-
tion of labour, and cramping the enterprize of science and
experience. There are taxes which operate directly
against the extension of our manufactures ; and, from my
connection with the commission presently going on relative
to the excise laws, 1 have seen the injurious consequences
of such taxes in reference to the manufacture of paper,
soap, and glass, which I am quite convinced operate ma-
terially against the interests of the country. It is not so
much for increasing the cost, but it is the check which is
given to improvement which is to be complained of.
We see that when a manufacture is free it improves
and extends, thus furnishing a conclusive reason for the
necessity which exists for repealing, in the first place,

TO THE _EDITOR OF THE SUN.

SIR,—In your Paper of the 31st of January you say
that " the people of Bristol have set a noble example to
countrymenin the West of England, which you
will be duly appreciated and acted upon."
NFORr, ENGLAND needed
Sir, you may not be aware, that the WEST
O
have
their
no
doubt
needed not the tardy " example" of the
E
CITY OF BRISTOL to instruct it in its duty. During the
last twenty years (in times, when Reformers were much
more rare, and much less popular than now, in this
eleventh hour,) the counties of Devon and Cornwall
have repeatedly assembled to raise their voices against
the abominations of the borough system. In Cornwall,--
despite all its boroughs and borough proprietors—there
have been not less than ten COUNTY MEETINGS within that
period, at all of which petitions have been carried (in
many instances, unanimously) for a Reform in the repre-
sentation of the people.
In mercy, therefore, in common justice, Sir, spare the
freemen of Devonshire and Cornwall from the mor-
tification of being supposed to follow in the train
of the supporters of Baillie and Hart Davies,--lof the men
who, only five months ago, rejected Mr. Protiieroe for no
other reason than because, in common with other Chris-
tians, he had expressed his hostility to the present system
of West India slavery !
I remain, Sir,
Your constant reader and friend,
A FREEHOLDER OF THE WEST.

P.S. The last meeting of the county of Cornwall to
petition for Reform was held at 13odinin on the 19th of
January—the first meeting at Bristol was on the 21st day
of the tonic month. Feb. 2, 1831.

fWe insert this letter as an act of justice to our corre-
dpoadent, who, however, is under an error if he supposes
we ever intended to throw a slur on the activity of the
West of England in the cause of Reform. Such an idea
never entered our minds for an instant.)—En.

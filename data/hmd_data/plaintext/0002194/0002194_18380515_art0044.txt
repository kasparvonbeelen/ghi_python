GLOUCESTER-SATURDAY.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE SUN.
Sia—Much admiring your holiest course, in all humane and charit.
able matters, I am induced to trouble you with a few lines on the con-
duct of Ministers respecting the dismissal from office of Lord C. Fitzroy.
Is it possible that our young and virtuous Queen can be the dupe of such
conduct ? Is it possible she can allow a noble, generous, feeling, and
virtuous man to be discarded—meanly discarded from his office, because
he voted according to conscience? It is impossible'. Let the'people of
England arouse themselves. Let them get up memorials to the Throne—
let them get up subscriptions, to present to such a " Christian" some
token of their admiration. The Marquis of Sligo acted well, even at
the eleventh hour, we all admit. Surely the people of England, then,
will not be backward, in their zeal for the cause of negro slavery, in
doing alike for such an act in Lord C. Fitzroy's case. The conduct of
Ministers, at the time of the Reform Bill, encouraged agitation and
pressure even front the lowest in society—the poor deluded wretches who
fancied they should have bread for nothing—but when the united voices
of the serious; pious, thinking Christians, cry aloud for mercy, they
are discarded, and called Christian dogs ! Beware, oh ye professing
Liberal men I—ye wolves in sheep's clothing—if your downfall is not
near at hand, lam Mistaken. The 21st of June will be a day when the
brightest jewel in the Crown will be tarnished by the curse of slavery.
" Oh! fie upon—fie upon it; it is foul—it smells to heaven."
Your well wisher, EMANCIPATOR.

er Majesty and the Duchess of Kent visited the
Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park, on Saturday.
The Duke of Wellington's grand banquet on Satur-
day evening, at Apsley House, was given to a party of thirty.seven of the
leading Conservative Peers. Among the company were the Dukes of
Northumberland, Beaufort, Newcastle, Dorset, Rutland; Marquises of
Hertford, Bute, Exeter, Salisbury, and Londonderry; Earls of Roden,
Winchilsea, Mansfield, Jersey, De Grey, Falmouth, Brownlow ; Lords

Rothsay, Forester, &c.

Marquis and Marchioness Cholmondeley, Lord and Lady Galloway,

Lieut. 11. Morgan, of her Majesty's ship Pembroke,
has been tried by a Court-martial at Malta, in consequence of assertions
made by two midshipmen of that ship, affecting his character as an
officer and a gentleman. The Court considered the evidence suffi-
cient, and dismissed him her Majesty's service.
Yesterday, at the early hour of 12 a.m., upwards of
IGO of the leading Members of the Opposition in both Houses of
Parliament assembled at Apsley House The subject of discussion was
understood to be the Irish Poor-law Bill, which lately passed the House
of Commons.

The Dowager Queen of Naples is said to be on the
point of marrying a Neapolitan Nobleman, only twenty-eight Tens of
age. As her Majesty is somewhat older, being born in 178,9, the young
man is said to have required a large pecuniary sum to make up for the
difference in their years. The amount is under consideration, and
constitutes the only impediment to their union.
Admiral the Right Hon. Sir G. Cockburn, will
take the chair at the ensuiug annual General Meeting of the friends and
supporters of the Royal Naval School

On Friday evening, F. B. Calvert, A.1V1., of King's
College, Ab:rdeen, concluded his lectures on the Poets, at the Institu-
tion, Chanctery-lane. The Lake School, with Campbell, Moore, Scott,
and Byron, formed the subjects of this last lecture, and the characte-
ristics of these Poets were sketched with the same masterly and kiscri-
minating hand as all the preceding ones. The theatre of the Institution
was extremely full.
Saturday evening a troop of the 10th Hussars ar-
rived in Chesterfield from Nottingham barracks, for the supposed pur-
pose of quelling any disturbance that might at ise in the neighbourhood
of Alfreton by the excavators employed on the railway, and also for the
protection of property. Monday afternoon, however, the troops returned
to Nottingham, the commanding-officer having had some conversation
with the Magistrates, who, we understand, stated that they had not sent
for the soldiers, but, on the contrary, were of opinion that the civil power
was sufficient in this neighbourhood to quell any ordinary disturbance.
Thero appears to have been some mistake.__Derky

MONEY AND COMMERCIAL NEWS,•

CITY (THIS DAY), TWELVE O'CLOCK.
We have received Cape of Good Hope papers to the 25th Feb. We
extract the following :
"An unusually long list of " Cattle stolen and missing" on the
frontier, appears in the town journal, and some rumours of war in
Caffcrland itself, are also reported. Such reports, whether strictly cor-
rect or not, are calculated to keep Government and the frontier author
rities always uneasy."
We have received Rio Janeiro Papers to the 29th Feb., bringing the
exchange on London 28, Stocks, Sq.
The accounts in the Rio papers state that Sergio, the Commander of
the rebels, had passed over to the Imperial forces with 120,000 cart-
ridges. The state of affairs in Bahia, according to the last accounts, is
looked upon as considerably more favourable, and as drawing towards a
speedy conclusion.
The accounts from Rio Grande are also of a favourable nature. The
Imperial forces have raised the seige of Porto Alegre. In Stocks there
has been latterly very little doing ; the rate of 6 per Cents, has gradually
declined from 81 to 86k. Some small business has been done in the
Exchange at 28 to 28* and 28i. It is now looking very firm at the
latter rate, at which there are still bills.
Sydney papers have been this day received to the 12th of November.
The long continued drought has greatly reduced the supplies of vege-
tables and potatoes. Colonial potatoes selling at 14s. to 16s. per cwt.
Extract of a letter from Rio Janeiro, of the 28th February, posted et
the North and South American Coffee House :
" Since our last advices our commercial affairs have decidedly ilt•
proved. The accounts from Rio Grande are very satisfactory, and the
news from Bahia (ten days later) lead us to suspect that the town has
surrendered to the legal authorities long before this. The trifling dis-
turbances in Pernambuco were easily put down. No new bonds will be
issued by the Minister of Finance far some time to come. The OP""
sum and the Dublin packets will leave here in about ten days, when I
hope to send you more decided intelligence. Exchange on London 25
to 28* ; Stocks 861, rather sellers."
THE FUNDS.
Consols closed rather heavy yesterday at 93 % to 94 both for the
Account and Money. The motion last night in the House of Coret°°"
by Sir T. Ackland rather agitated the market, and the adjournment of the debate to this day will still operate on the market, and no trans-
action of importance is likely to take place until the division is known'
Consols are rather better this morning than they closed at YesterdaY'

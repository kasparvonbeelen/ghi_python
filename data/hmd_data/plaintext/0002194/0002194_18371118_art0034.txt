SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.

tinguish between the honest politics of 1688 and the
degenerate Whiggery of 1837, begin at lennth to yield
a slow and mortifying credence to the facts—first, that
the Melbourne Whigs are a knot of despicable empi-
ri6e_e—and secondly, that in trusting them so long they
themselves have been a set of egregious dupes. Ac-
cording to a well-known feature of human frailty,these
men find it convenient to say as little. as possible ; in
other words, being thoroughly disgusted and disap-
pointed at the manner in which the professions of their
political leaders have been violated, they are restrained
from open mutiny only by false pride, or by a discre-
ditable anxiety to escape the twofold charge of apostacy
and fickleness. Now, to what extent this secret disa-
tisfaction prevails among the professed supporters of the
Whigs, it were by no means easy to say; but if we
may reason from the loud and irrepressible murmurs in
which it occasionally vents itself in different parts of
the empire, we should certainly infer that there is
scarcely a man in ten (whether Conservative or Libe-
ral) who is not deeply convinced that the Government
of Lord Melbourne is unworthy of public confidence.
Take, for instance, that large portion of our country-
men (including undoubtedly an immense number of
Reformers and Dissenters) who feel a lively interest in
the abolition of negro bondage. The question, touch-
ing the emancipation and treatment of the slave popu-
lation in British colonies, has never in any sense been
a party one ; and as the various Anti- Slavery Societies
throughout the kingdom were originally constituted on
the simple principles of humanity and justice, apart
from political biasses, so in as far as those Societies have
subsequently co-operated in watching the working of
the apprenticeship system, the notion that they have
been actuated by party motives has never once been
dreamt of. Nay, if they have bad any political predilec-
tions at all in their associate capacity, such predilec-
tions, we are confident, were decidedly in favour of the
Whigs. To the politicians who had been instrumental
in:passing the Emancipation Act they were disposed to
extend every reasonable confidence. Neither the in-
crease of Whig patronage by the appointment of sti-
pendiary Magistrates, nor the large discretionary powers
entrusted to these functionaries, were looked at with the
slightest jealousy. The belief that the Act was and is
(if properly administered) an honest and efficient mea-
sure for the accomplishment of its great object, was
universal ; and with this conviction, far from grudging
the costly conditions of its enactment, all that the
friends of the measure cared for was to see that its
provisions were scrupulously carried into effect on
behalf of the helpless beings whose grievances it
professed to redress. Now, that the Slave Emancipa-
tion Bill, in the hands of a humane and incorrupt
Government, incapable of sacrificing its object to the
vile purposes of party patronage, is sufficiently pro-
tective to realize all the good which its most sanguine
friends anticipated, we shall not stop to prove. The
stipendiary magistrates, amenable to an upright and
firm Minister like Lord Stanley, would not have
been suffered to abuse their power with impunity.
It turns out, however, that under Lord Melbourne's
auspices, tbe Slave Einancipaticn Act has op to
this moment been little else than a dead letter.
The apprenticeship system, instead of putting an
end to the evils of slavery, has in most instances
aggravated its horrors. It will not do to say that the
fault is attributable rather to the insufficient provisions
of the bill than to any criminality in the parties in-
trusted with its administration. This is out outrageous
nonsense. The entire body of evidence which has
reached the Committees in this country who have
been watching its practical working, tends to show
that the Act has been regularly Lurked, if not by the
agency of the Whigs, at least by their connivance.
Like every measure they have but their hand to, it is
now discovered to be, in practice, an enormous itnpos-
titre : and thus tile same'sort of complaint which many
of their fellow Liberals have brought against their Re-
form Bill, is directed with far more force and propriety
against their perversion of a statute on whose enact-
ment they have equally plumed themselves, as an evi-
dence of their public virtue. And by whom are these
serious charges brought against the Whigs, on the sub-
ject of negro slavery ? By Tory meetings, or by party
parsons, or by the Conservative press ? No such thing.
The principal pa: ties to the indictment are Liberals, and
Liberals too of the first water, such as your Buxtons and
Burnetts, and other champions of the anti-slavery
cause. Already, and very recently, has his Royal
highness the Duke of Sussex presided at a great re-
monstrant meeting, wherein, after deprecating the utter
waste of the 20,000,0001. sterling which were given
to the apprentice-masters, it was expressly and em-
phatically declared, that petitions to the Legislature on
behalf of the oppressed negrocs were as necessary as
ever. It consists, moreover, with our own knowledge,
that vast numbers of English ladies are at this mo-
-ment procuring signatures to a petition, which will
shortly be presented to the Queen, imploring the sym-
pathies and succours of a female Sovereign on behalf
of her injured sex in her Majesty's own colonial pos-
sessions : nor have many days elapsed since an im-
mense assemb:y of anti-slavery delegates from the mid-
land counties was he'd at Birmingham, at which a
series of resolutions was passed, condemning in the
strongest terms the disgraceful proceedings whereby
the Emancipation Bill has been rendered a complete
nullity.—Times.

A letter from Hanover, forwarded by our Frankfort
correspondent, represents the state of public feeling in
that country as menacing an outbreak. The Univer-
sity of Gottingen especially was in a state of the
greatest excitement, the aged professorsoot less liberal
and animated than their scholars. That Tory par ex-
cellence, King Ernest, talkS in his official Gazette of
the necessity of fortifying his sea-ports against a foreign
invasion. This invasion, no doubt, is to come from
England. Poor dotard I whilst he is in Germany we
shall leave the Germans to deal with him, and shall.
only pray that he, his friends, and his principles
may never invade us. It is after all a sagacious
instinct in him which makes him look on England
as the country of his most, inveterate foe. He must
be fully aware how very small a portion of En,
glishmen sympathise with those Tory journals,
who, with ample consistency, uphold the right divine
of King Ernest to make and overthrow constitu-
tions. The question, as regardi the character which
4---eught to be given to the conduct of the King of Ha-
nover, lies in a nutshell. Was the Constitution of
1833 the law of the land ? If it were the law, the
patents of Ernest are necessarily illegal. We observe
that the Standard, founding upon the statements in
these patents; declares that the Constitution of 1819,
being in active operation in 1833, could only be le-
gally set aside by the mutual consent of the King and
the -Estates ; and that as the consent of the Estates was
not given, the Constitution of 1833 was illegal, and the
Constitution of 1819, never having been legally an-
nulled,
must now be considered in activity. The Con-
stitution of 1833 was not an affair struck off at a heat.
In the early part of 1831 the Hanoverian Parliament
took up the subject of Constitutional Reform, and the
clauses of a new fundamental law were discussed in
the session of that year. - When Parliament was pro-
rooued on the 24th June, 1831, a Committee of the
e, •
Lower liOuse was continued for the purpose of pro-
ceeding with the consideration of this important mat-
ter, and in the spring of 1232, the Committee termi-
nated their labours. On the 13th of March, 1833-,
the Constitution passed the two Houses, and on the
26th of the following September received the Royal
Assent ; since which time it has been in constant
operation. We observe that a sort of pettifogging de-
fence has been set up for King Ernest in a pamphlet
just published, under the title of " The Hanoverian
Constitution Considered ;" that certain alterations were
made by the King in the Constitution as agreed to by
the Estates on the 13th of March, 1833, to which
the assent of the Estates was not demanded ; and
that the fundamental law of September 26, 1833,
ratifies these alterations, as well as what had re-
ceived the consent of the Parliament in March, 1833.
Assuming (for we are not cognizant of the cir-
cumstance) that amendments were made by the King
on the fundamental law as it passed the Parliament of
Hanover on the 13th of March, 1838, the reason why
the assent of the Estates was not fern-tally given to
them probably was, that, as the Parliament was not
then sitting, to have re-assembled Parliament inertly
to obtain their sanction to the alter tions made, weul.l
have been attended with inconvenience. That the
a:terations were acceptable to the Estates that adopted
the Constitution in 1838-is evident from the fact of
the universal acquiescence in the fundamental law of
the 26th of September, 1833. It is absurd to apply
rigidly. to our country the technical rules of the Legis-
lature of another. " What should we say," asks
the Advocate of King Ernest, "if the Lord
Chancellor should erase even one word in a
Bill, and then declare that, with this one era-
sure, le Roi le vent :9' And what if such a
transaction should occur a few days, nay a sinele
hour, after the dis,olution of Parliarricnt, in
which the Bill had rt:ceived the sanction -of the
two Houses ?" The ea:Ls are not analogous.
The King of Hanover was an absentee, and the
communication between Hanover and London of itself
required consideeable time ; and he could, besides, only
devote a small portion of his leisure from the important
concerns of Great Britan to the aiTairs of Hanover ;
and in an affair of such moment as the assent to a
fundamental law he could not without preparation sa-
tisfy himself as to the nature of the measure. In the
mean time the Hanoverian Parliament, hating termi-

-nated their labours, could not remain assembled in
Hanover for the mere purpose of voting their
formal assent to any changes which the King might
think fit to make. The assent of the estates must,
however, be inferred from the universal acquiescence in
the new fundamental law. But then we arc told in
the pamphlet that the Crown lands of Hanover be-
longed only to William as a tenant for life ; and vre
are told also that " the individual King of Great Bri-
tain on his accession surrenders his domains to Par-
liament for a stipulated equivalent, but he has no
power to bind his successors ; and the moment he
dies the successor re-enters upon the property of
those domains as absolutely as any of his prede-
cessors." The writer here confounds the practice with
the principle. The King and both Houses of Par-
liament do, in fact, at the commencement of every
reign, enter into a new arrangement respecting the
hereditary revenues ; but the King and the two
Houses may at once conclude a permanent arrange-
ment binding on future Sovereigns. Parliament
is omnipotent. And in reality portions of the
Crown lands have been in all times constantly
conveyed to individuals by Acts of Parliament. At
this time thousands of individuals in the county of
Middlesex hold properties lately obtained under a Par-
liamentary tenure, which in a new reign cannot be
challenged. This affair of the Crown lands proves
that King Ernest, like too many other Tories, is in-
fluenced -by the desire of pelf as well as a hatred of
constitutional government. He is believed to be much
in debt, and hence his wish to shake the disposition
which has been made of the Crown lands. From
every appearance he will find his undertaking attended
with more difficulties than he anticipated. Throughout
all constitutional Germany the Chambers are in mo-
tion. The Post Ampt Gazette of Frankfort last re-
ceived contains a report of the proceedings of the Se-
cond Chamber of the state of Saxony on the Bth inst.
on the affair of the Hanoverian Constitution. On
the attention of the Chamber having been called
to the fact of the Upper Chamber not having ac-
ceded to the resolutions which they had passed on
this subject on a former occasion, the President ad-
mitted the truth of this, but added that the circum-
stances of the case had now become so important, that
the Second Chamber ought to take the matter up
without delay. The Minister for Foreign Affairs then
said—" The Government still continues to think that
this question does not fall within the limits of the de-
liberations of this Chamber, and the reasons alleged
by it on a former occasion for the rejection of this mo-
tion exist the same at the present day. Nevertheless,
the events that have since occurred are of such a na-
ture, that all assemblies of States and all Governments
are bound to make serious reflections on the subject.
The Ministry, therefore, refers you to the declarations
which it has already made. Be assured, gentlemen,
that Government will act, according to its custom, in
a constitutional spirit, and will contribute, as far as
depends upon ituelf, to the maintenance of legal order
in Germany." It was moved that a special Committee
should be appointed to take the subject into considera-
tion, and the motion was carried by a majority of 65
to 3.—Morning Chronicle.
If any man should attempt to estimate the actual
unpopularity of the Whigs merely by the manner in
which they are spoken of in quarters strictly C - u nser-
vative, there is reason to believe that his calculation
would be a very defective one. The truth is, there
exists an immense mass of public opinion, which,
though commonly laid claim io in favour of Ministers,
cannot with the slightest justice be so appropriated.
We do not allude at present to the multitudes of starv-
ing labourers, who hate them for the sake of their
odious Poor-law; nor to the thousands of enfranchised
Liberals, who detest them for their hostility to House-
hold Suffrage ; nor even to the I:i•;.,body of Par-
liamentary democrats, who, while Inuatiy sitting at
their back in the House of Commons, make no scruple
to reprobate them as false and treacherous to the
popular cause. With these various sections of the
(arnest school, the more respectable discontents to
whom we refer have iittle or no co:rununity of feeling.
For the most pat the latter are sedate and sincere
Reformers, who, though hitherto unwilling to dis-

The circumstance of the celebrated Braintree case
having been brought before a legal tribunal, has again
attracted public attention, in no ordinary degree, to the
general question of Church-rates. Dr. Lushington,
knowing that whatever might be his decision, the losing
party would appeal to a higher tribunal, did not express
himself in very marked terms on either side of the
case. What the decision of the Court to which the
appeal is made may be, is more than we can tell.
Nor does it matter much what may be that decision.
The doom of Church-rates is sealed without reference
to the issue of the proceedings in the Braintree case.
If their exaction be pronounced, by the tribunal before
which the point is about to be submitted, to be legal,
then Parliament must forthwith pass an Act abolish-
ing these iniquitous imposts. If their exaction be pro-
nounced to be illegal under such circumstances as
those in which their Braintree opponents resisted
them, the necessary consequences will be, that all
other towns of any consequence will soon place them-
selves in opposition effectually to resist their payment.
In either case, we repeat, the doom of Church-rates is
sealed. Public opinion has for some time been irre-
eoncileably hostile to them, and now that opinion is
beginning to be unequivocally expressed on the subject.
And never has public opinion been freely and resolutely
expressed against any principle of oppression or in-
justice, without being speedily crowned with triumph.
The nation owes a debt of infinite gratitude to the
Dissenters on this subject. They were the first to as-
sert the great principle that no man has a right to be
taxed for the support of the religion of another ; and
that so long as those who dissent from the Church of
England are so, so long is religious liberty outraged,
and the rights of conscience trampled on. Ere many
months have elapsed, we are confident we shall have
to congratulate the Dissenters of England on the
complete triumph of their exertions to rid themselves
and the public at large of the grievous impost of
Cliurch-rates.—[ Since writing the above, we learn
that the Attorney-General has taken the usual steps
to stay proceedings in the Court of Queen's Bench.]—.

Last night a gentleman, named Jordan, who resides
in Parker's-place, Kent-road, was robbed of a valuable gold
watch and appendages, in the crowd at the pit door of Co-
vent-garden Theatre. Mr. Jordan felt the watch safe in
his pocket only a few minutes before he missed it. He
saspects the thief to be a woman who stood near him, and
complained loudly of the pushing of the crowd. A strong
Lair-guard to the watch was cut through.
Yesterday morning, between ten and eleven o'clock,
as a servant girl, named- Ann Pearce, was cleaning the
windows o 3 the first floor of the house of James Boughton,
Esq., of Gower-street, Bedford-square, she overbalanced
herself; and fell upon the iron rails beneath, on one of which
she hung until lifted off by some persons passing at the mo-
m. ent, who conveyed her to the hospital in a fainting state
from loss of blood, where she at present remains in a ver)
precarious condition.

the purpose of arranging agencies for the collecting and
embarking of immigrants. But the great'point to be ascer-
tained is, whether in those districts where coffee and sugar
are raised, European labourers can exist in a healthy
state, and compete with Africans. Should the Society
remove all doubts on this point, by making the experi-
ment successful, they would have the merit of doing
more for the abolition of slavery than all that the most
enthusiastic and sanguine philanthropists have yet done.
When free labour shall compete successfully with slave
labour, slavery will he abolished. The following re-
marks, in which we entirely concur, are taken from a
Morning Contemporary :
" In considering the objects of this Society, which
laudably seeks to accomplish them by facilitating vo-
luntary emigration only from hence and elsewhere, it
must be borne in mind that the Government, well dis-
posed as it was to lend its sanction and to encou-
rage, so far as the state of public opinion permitted,
immigration into the West Indies, to supply the
deficiency of labour notoriously existing, and so to
increase the production on which the receipts of a
large branch of revenue were contingent, were not
able nevertheless to carry the measure they pro-
posed into effect, from the conflict of opinion
and prejudice arrayed .cgainst it in one quarter,
and from the inimical combination of another quar-
ter in opposition ; inicizal only because, the pro-
jected licence of immigration being confined to the
Mauritius, solely was too partial in its proportions and

of trial only, the successful results of which might lead
to its extension to the West Indies ; but, as the old
saying has it, whilst the grass grows the ox starves.
Such are the necessities, such the destitute position of
the West Indies, for want of an adequate supply of la-
bour hands, that unless instant, not prospective and dis-
tant, relief be afforded, the colonies, daily declining in
productiveness, may be ruined past redemption before
the day of promised succour arrives. To the mother
country it is of incalculable importance, both politically
and commercially, that the West Indies should be
maintained as an immense field of production for the
tropical products, equal to the supply not of
this empire only, but of the whole world. And these
colonies possess the peculiar advantage of closer proxi-
mity to the parent state than any other portion of the
British dominions from which the same products can be
derived, and therefore are so much more secure of pos-
session, whilst they form the very best nursery of a
commercial marine, which must ever be the basis of
naval ascendancy.

" The system- and regulations laid down for the pro-
motion of immigration on the most wise awl humane
principles, with the view, to the introduction only of a
working population of the best moral, religious, and
sober habits. are greatly creditable to the Society, and
the strongest assurance of its success ' and beneficial
working to all parties, both in the profit sense to the
shareholders and liberal remuneration secured to the
immigrants."

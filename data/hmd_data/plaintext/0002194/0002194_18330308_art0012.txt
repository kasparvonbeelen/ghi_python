SPORTING INTELLI-ENCE.

TATTERSALL'S.
Two or three alterations occurred in the Derby betting.
Revenge became first favourite by half a point, and is likely to
make a further advance. The Moses colt was reported to be
" coughing," and fell back to 20 to 1, offers were made to take
'5 to 1. Ishmael is repeatedly the subject of talk, and offers to
bet and take the odds are constantly made, but of so indefinite
a nature, that we are unable to state any price. It is rumoured
that if he goes to Newmarket it will be to George Edwards's
stables, and not to Lord Jersey's regular trainer, Mr. James
Edwards. A few bets were made on the Riddlesworth and St.
Leger ; the odds averaged as follows :--

o'clock, several private Bills were brought up by Mr.
Wood and other Members.

Lord KING presented a petition from the parish of St.
Mary's, in the Strand, for the repeal of the house and win-
dow taxe.. It was far from being the wish of the petitioners
to embarravi the Government, but they thought that by a
proper reduction of expenditure, the repeal of those taxes,
which bore heavily upon the people, might be safely
effected.

The Duke of RICHMOND presented petitions from
Horsham, Sussex, and other I laces in that county, and in
the absence of the Duke of Devonshire, from a parish in
Fife, for the better observance of the Sabbath.
Lord TENIPLEMORE presented a petition from a
parish in the county of Southampton to the same effect.
Lord BEXLEY presented a petition from the parish of
St. Mary, Newington, also to the like effect.

The Earl of ALBEAIARLE prepented a petition from
Stony Stratford, praying for the immediate abolition of

silvery.

tersea and Ewell, Surrey, praying for the better observance
of the Lord's Day.
The Earl of ROSEBERY presented petitions from
the Political Union of the town of Kilkenny, praying for
the repeal of the Union. Also various other petitions
from different parts of Ireland against the Coercive Bill,
for the abolition of tithes, and for the vote by ballot.
The Bishop of LONDON presented a petition from
Poi‘itnerr, Suffolk, praying for the immediate abolition of
slavery, and the better observance of the Sabbath.—
/Hear.) Also petitions praying for the better observ-
ance of the Sabbath from Sr. Mary-at-Hill, signed

education in Ireland.

vance of the Sabbath, by Lord ',ILFORD, Earl GRFY, and
two Bishops.
Earl GREY preserved a petition from a pa►ish in Ire-
land, praying for an inquiry into the state of Ireland, be-
fore the Coercive Bill was passed into a law. The
Noble Earl said he presented the petition as it had been
sent to hits, but it was needless for him to say that he did
scot agree with the prayer of the petition.
The House then adjourned.

We have the following letter from Algiers, dated
23d August :

" The Pluto steam.b.nat, which left Cherchell on the
20th, brings us the following news from that toWr, which
has been vigorously attacked lay the Arabs :
" In the night of the Ittb, or, rather, at one o'clock
in the morning on the 16th, a great noise was heard.
It was the Bey of Medeah, who, at the head of a conti--
derable corps of troops, suddenly attacked out out-posts,
which were forced to yield, The enemy having broken
our lines rushed impetuously towards the town, and
succeeded in getting possession of the Marabout, and.
retreated to the East of the Algiers gate. Meantime
the firing of musketry and cannon was heard on all
sides, and the Masafran Xebec, stationed in the port,
brought to at a short distance from the coast, and di-
rected its force against the Arabs.
" The Marabout on the East was retaken at the point
of the bayonet by our brave Zapkirs. We had 18 men
killed and 12 wounded.

An Arab who came into the town yesterday, states
the lass of the Arabs at 80 killed, and a considerable
number wounded. They tvere really commanded by
the Bey of Medeah.—Le Constiintionnel.

POSTAGE STAMPS..—Any persons attempting to

the stamps a second time, are liable to a penalty of
201. for every offence, under the ad and 4th Victoria,
cap. 96, sec. 23, passed last session.
Cnuacx EXTENSION.—We quoted en Monday a
paragraph, which showed that in Glasgow the unlet
sittings of the churches are rapidly and progressively
increasing, in fact, while the priests are demanding
more and more money from the nation, the people are
separating more and more from them, and-coming to
disregard, not to say despise, them. The priests have
made common cause with the Tories, who are the
avowed enemies of the people, and they are treated as
Tories. They support Corn-laws, they teach submis-
sion to oppression, they declare that ►t is contrary to
God's laws for mca to throw off slavery, and the people
are throwing them off for their slavish doctrines. The
people are setting up a political religion of their own,
and establishing their own churches. Here is an ex-
planation, borrowed from the Glasgow Argue, of the
cause of unlet sittings in the Glasgow Churches :
" CHARTIST CHURCHES.—One of the most remark-
able features of Chartism, in this part of the country,
is the number of places of worship which are opening in
the various localities where their numerical strength is
greatest. They have sermon regularly bn Sabbaths in
Glasgow, Hamilton, Lanark, Paisley, Greenock, Eagle-
sham, Kilbarchan, and other towns in the neighbour-
hood, and in all these places lay-preachers officiate by
turns. They regularly baptise children, and we under-
stead that the sacrament was to have been dispensed by
them yesterday in the town of Kilbarchan. The
Chartist Churches are founded, not upon any religious,
but upon a political principle, and are therefore, in the
strictest sense of the term, political Churches."

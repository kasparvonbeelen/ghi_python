From ttie extraordinary fecundity and other
estimable qualities of the potato onion, it promises to be-
come one of our most valuable garden productions. Like
the plant whose name it bears, and widely different from
its own kind, this useful vegetable multiplies under ground,
each stem producing several onions, nowise inferior to the
best of the species. But its most remarkable property is
the power it possesses of resisting or surviving putrefac-
tion. In November last a gentleman in Cumberland had
a quantity of these prolific onions for household consump-
tion, but, for want of due attention, many of them be-
came unfit for use, and apparently quite rotten. With
little hope of their revival, he placed these putrid bulbs in
his garden, about six inches under ground, and at a small
distance apart, spreading immediately over them a mode-
rate quantity of litter. Here they remained about four
months, and when examined a few days ago, were found
in a state of perfect soundness, full of vegetable life, and
ready for transplanting. Notwithstanding the length and
severity of the winter, the roots could not have been in a
more healthy state, or better adapted either for seed or
culinary purpose*.

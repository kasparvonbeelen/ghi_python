This Address., therefOre urges no additional claims
to' public*fuobur , further than may* be supposed to,
arise from the adMission of a fresh .o»iductor to the
Paper,, who will bring* with him, at least, affections
kenuincly Pritish, and the assiduity, diligenc'e, in-
&Wry, and Vertion,.alt:Pildani upon* the engageMcnt
in new pursuit. Ire this aweful when teary
day brings forth-wonders, and Ike jaithfia record of
en:lag pi/SO full of interest. and importance, it will
be his study: pot only to merit the continuance .of
that, large portion of support Which Tun SUN 6/joys,
but also. by
,unremitting and claborlite attention_ to
the various departmeniS within the scope of a News
paper by the acquisition, and 'communication 'of
early intelligence front those parts where the fate of
the' World is rit stake ; by Yull and accurate in.forfita
tion On internal affairs; by original and copious np-
tiee_of :subjects connected with the. Arts, Sciences.,
Drama, and k'olite Literature ; to advance, the
publication to extended *favour and augmented. pa-
fronage.

It is scarcely requisite to add,, that the same
punctuality and regard to timely publication, and
It- to the conspicuous insertion Q/ Advertisements, which
'have hitherto been found so beneficial, strictly
adhered to.

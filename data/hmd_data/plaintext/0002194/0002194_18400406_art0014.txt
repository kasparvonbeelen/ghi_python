the part of the carman, when the case was all at
once dismissed by the Magistrate on the ground that
a servant is not a witness within the meaning of
the Act 1 If this be the law, no time should be
lost in altering it ; for unless servants are compe-

defendant's own witness.

Lisbon Papers of the 30th ult. have arrived, but
their contents are unimportant. Nothing was thought
of but the elections, which were only to commence on
the sth inst. Appearances were in favour of the Mi-
nisters, who anticipated on the whole returns a consi-
derable majority. Of the virulence of tbe
pro-slavery faction same idea may be formed by the fol-
lowing address to the electors of Santarem, which was
extensively circulated, and placarded on the walls of

thAt town :
" Portuguese, Setembrists, and Royalists !
The English wish to lay bands upon our as well as
their own slaves They ask our lands, and some there are

who would give them.
He who has any love for his country be on the alert.
" Setembrists and Royalists, let us go to the urn ; let us
elect men who are Portuguese, who are lovers of the
people, and of the good of their country. Our nationality
is in danger. War to the overbearing proud English, who
send our vessels carrying the ensigns with the five wounds
of Christ to the bottom of the sea, and who wish now to
sell us to England, and who have robbed us of our money.
ni?.tembrists and Royalist., eternal hatred to the
chaniarros Jacobins, who have robbed us of the silver and
gold of our churches and convents, and it it for this that
we pay every day decimas upon decimas I Take care of
the ragam 1 ffins of the charter. Vote not with such
people; vote for honourable men, who will make laws,
who will bring us peace and daily bread."
Mosen Renet was renowned for the murders and crimes
he had committed. If it is true that this wretch has at
la! expired in the very rank.; of his old associates, it is
but a dispensation from Providence to place him on a par
with the Dount d'Espagne.
Letters from Saragossa, of the 28th of March, state—
" It is confidently stated that the army is to march upon
Mora, in order to blcck up the passage from Catalonia,
and thence upon Cantavieja and Morella."
Private letters from Osija, frontiers of Catalonia, state
that Cabrera had arrested and brought before a Council
of War several members of the janta, suspected of having
assisted at the assassination of the Count d'Espagne.

They are far more prejudicial to the Portuguese tltern:

who either make or countenance them.

The Paris Journals of Friday and Saturday have
Leen duly received. They publish a mass of local in-
tehigence, but nothing whatever of the slightest in-
terest to any English reader. On Friday the Dukes of
OaLEAris and D'AUMALE set out for Algiers, to gather
the ripe laurels at present within the grasp of the
veteran officers who have served for years under the
seorehing suns of Africa, their life-blood daily in danger
of being drunk by the swords of the Arabs.
On the '2&d inst. the marriage of the Duke de NE-
tiottO with the Princess of SAXE COBURG GOTHA
l!'iM be celebrated at St. Cloud. We have not yet
learned how many of the Deputies who refused the
dotation ate to be invited to the nuptials.
A letter from Algiers, of the 23d of March, contains
tie following news—.. •
1, We can no longer depend on the least security beyond
the incetediate vicinity of Algiers. Some horsemen who
had lately arrived from France, and who had been a
cohort
ort
time from Bledah, had gone, without precaution, toll
wood; they were attacked by about two hundred Arabs,
Vho massacred several of them.
" /In equally unhApPY event bas just occurred at Dotl6/0.
There too Chasseurs, Who bad lately arrived from France,
hiving imprudently left the Carnp, were attacked by a nu-
merous
body of Arabs. The gendarmes and the
when alley
immediately hastened to their assistin:ce, but
reached the spot, the enemy had carried off a dozen of the
Chasseurs. These Arabs were taken on this occasion, and
have been brought to the prison at Algiers,''
A journal says that, according to letters received yer•ter.
day at Paris, a part of the French cavalry had been carried
off by the Arabs at the distance of four leagues from
Algiers, and that at Komba (one league from Algiers) a
part of the Foreign Legion, consisting of 67 men, most of
them Spania7ds, bad massacred their officers, and deserted
to the enemy. , . - - .; ~ .

"".7!,----
Madrid Papers of the 28th ult. have reached us.
The Address bad been adopted after a well-fought bat-
tle on the part of the Opposition, in which nothing was
gained but the consciousness of having fearlessly done
their duty. As for the Ministers they gave themselves
very little trouble, relying wholly upon the votes of a
packed majority', It was stated that they had agreed to
borrow another loan of ten millions of francs, to be sup-
plied by the House of ROTILSCIIILDS on a new to-
bacco monopoly contract.
The following is the latest news from the Spanish
1
provinces :
The prisoners taken at Castellote entered Alcoriza as
•he Eco de Aragon; states, on the 27th ale. They were
287 soldiers, 15 officers, one surgeon, one monk, the chap-
lain, and three women. They were followed shortly slier
by 60 wounded. The Governor was Pedro Marco, for•
merly a petty shopkeeper at Alcoriza. The courageous
defence of the fort excited universal admiration, even
among the Queen's troops.
Tristany was not the chief of a party, he was only a fe-
rocious, narrow-minded, sanguinary scoundrel. He was the
art ry type of a Spanish monk in the worst sense of the term
--viz., as belonging to a Catalonian party which is noted
for its cruelty.

THE CORN-LAW Divistorc—Many Members paired
off on Friday evening from a conviction that no divi-
sion would take place. Many others stayed away on the
same conviction. In fact, there Was a general impres-
sion amongst the Members, which was justified by the
number of persons who intended to speak, that there
would be no division on Friday evening. The Tories
and the Corn-law men, however, were so eager to put
down further discussion, that they departed from the
ordinary usage of Parliament, and violated one of those
general understandings, without which business cannot
be carried on, to put an end to the debate.

Colonel Gore Langton paired off with Mr.
Cartwright, M.P., for Northamptonshire, on Friday night, in
favour of Mr. Villiers's motion on the Corn-laws.
BRISTOL SUGAR MARKET, APRIL 3.—A
considerable number of the late imports of Mauritius sugar
have been disposed of since our last, principally to the refiners.
The great flatness of the London market, and difficulty of
snaking sales, induced our merchants to meet the buyers more
readily, which led to a tolerably fair business being transacted.
Of other descriptions of sugar we have no supply.
DESTRUCTIVE FlRE.—This morning, about
one o'clock, a fire broke out in the White Hart public house,
kept by Mr. Darker, Milbank. The policeman on duty gave
the alarm, and roused the inmates, who escaped with great
difficulty. Two men, it is said, leaped from a window on the
pavement, and received serious injury, but no lives were lost.
About four o'clock the walls of the premises of Mr. parker fell
with a tremendous crash, and several of the firemen narrowly
escaped with their lives, one of them, however, named William
Pross, of the Chandos-street station, not so fortunate as the
others, was buried in the ruins : he was quickly extricated,
when it was ascertained that he had sustained seme serious
injuries. He was conveyed to a surgeon's, and from thence to
the fire-station in Chandos-street, where he lies in a very
precarious state.

A
zeorrisu HOSPITAL.--TheAnniversary Fes-
tival of this very excellent national charity was celebrated on
Saturday, according to long custom, at the Freemasons' Ta-
vern, Great Queen-street. His Grace the Duke of Sutherland
took the chair. The Noble Duke was supported by the Duke
of Roxburgh, the Hon. F. Motile, the Hcn. Admiral Mackey,
and nearly 100 gentlemen more immediately connected with
Scotland, After several toasts were drank, the Secretary real
the report of the proceedings of the evening, from which it ap-
pears that upwards of 5001. had been added to the funds of the
Society. Her Majesty the Queen was announced as a sub-
scriber of 1051. ; the Queen Dowager as a subscriber of 501.
annually; and the Noble Duke in the Chair as a subscriber of
501. The funds of this institution are in a flourishing state;
there are, however, so many applicants for relief, that without
increased exertions on the part of the benevolent, its sphere of
utility cannot be carried on to its full extent.
WOODSTOCK.---This town, which has for so
many years presented so dull a prospect to visitors, is about to
resume its former attractions. Elenheim Palace is being
thoroughly repaired, and Fair Rosamond's well, with the mo-
foments in the park, have already been cleaned, and recovered
from the dirty state they were in. The town on Thursday__
presented a gayer appearance than is has done for years. The,
Duke of Marlborough, accompanied by the Duchess,
arrived
the course of the day. The houses were decorated with laurels
and evergreens,
in
church, Whose
and evergreens flags flying from the tower of the
bells sent forth, during the day, merry peals, and cannon were
.
fired at intervals; the gate, ;it. the ..ntre in" "

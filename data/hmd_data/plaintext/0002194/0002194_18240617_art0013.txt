PARLIAMENT.,

'HOUSE OF LORDS, Jtrxs 16.
lIIESSAGE FROM THE COMMONS.
Mr. HERMES, and others from the Commons, brought up
the-Irish Magistrates' Indemnity Bill ; the Dublin Police Bill
the Irish Tithes' Composition Bill, with the Lord's amend-
ment agreed:to,"and several private Bills.
SCOTCH JUDICATURE BILL.
The LORD CHANCELLOR informed their Lordships
that when he got home last night he found a petition from the
Dean and Facility of Edinburgh, against the Scotch Judicature
Bill;. but as that measure had already received their Lord-
ships' sanction, he should not present it.

MARINE INSURANCE BILL.
The Earl of LAUDERDALE presented a petition from cer
tain underwriters, praying that they may be heard by Counse
at their Lordships' bar, against the Marine Insurance NI
passing into a law. ..

IRISH STEAM PACKET BILL.
On the third reading of the Irish Steam Packet Bill heir.
moved,

The Earl of LAUDERDALE objected to it, and observed
that it was as complete a job as ever came before their Lord-
ships. He moved that it be read a third time that day three
months.
This motion was agreed to, and the Bill in consequence
thrown out.

EQUITABLE LOAN BILL.
The Earl of DERBY-presented a petition from certain inha-
bitants of llancliester and Salford, in favour of the Equitable
Loan Bill.—Laid on the table. •
'The Manchester and Salford Equitable Loan Bill was read a
third time and passed. -
- On the Dublin Equitable Loan Bill being read, a second time,
The Earl of LAUDERDALE said he should certainly op-
pose it in a future stage.—The Bill was committed for Friday.
STA NDING ORDERS.
The Earl of pARROWBY moved the suspension of the
Standing Other, that required four-lifths of the capital of a pro-
posed chartered company to be paid before a Bill, sanctioning
its operation, could be read a second time. 116 moved this
suspension, that a Bill might be read a second time, the object
of which was, to establish a chartered company in Ireland, for
the purpose of working mines. The employment of capital in
Ireland in this way was of so much utility, that ha trusted their
Lordships would agree to the motion.
The Noble Earl's motion was agreed to, and the Bill read a
second time.
..

COLONIAL SLAVERY.
Lord SUFFIELD presented a Petition from Chippenham,
in Gloucestershire, praying for the gradual abolition of slavery
in the Colonies.

SCOTCH JURIES.
The Earl of LAUDERDALE moved that this Bill be com-
mitted, and observed, that an alteration in the present law was
necessary. A Bill had been introduced a year or two since, in
which the selection of the Jury was by ballot, but that mode
was considered objectionable ; and the selection was by rota-
tion in this Bill, which it was thought would be unobjectiona-
ble. He cared but little what course was adopted, so that the
evil complained of was remedied ; and he thought the present
measure would have the effect of bringing► Juries into Court
impartially selected. The Noble Lord moved that the Bill be
committed.

Viscount MELVILLE observed it was his intention to in-
troduce a measure in the next Session, to relieve Judges from
the responsibilty of selecting Juries. He hoped the Noble Earl
would withdraw his motion, or he should move that itbe com-
mitted this day two months.
The Earl of ROSSLYN supported the Bill, and at the same
time expressed his satisfaction at the intention of the Noble
Viscount to introdude a measure on the subject next Session ;
but he could see no reason for the Bill not being committed
now, as objections might there be made to it anti its errors cor-
rected. The power given to the Judges relative to the selection
of Juries had long been matter of complaint. The present
measure would certainly remedy that evil.
After a few words from the Duke of ATHOL and the Earl of
ABERDEEN in favour of the amendment, and from the Earl of
LAUDERDALE in reply, Lord Melville's amendment was
agreed to without a division.
NEW CHURCHES.
The Earl of LIVERPOOL stated that he should to-morrow
move the second reading of the New Churches Building Bill.
COUNTY GAOLS AMENDMENT BILL.
On the second reading of the County Gaols Amendment
Bill being moved,
Lord SFFIELD proposed that the minimum of classes of
prisoners should be foul, instead of three.
The Earl of LIV.aRPOOL said, that the point had been
maturely considered by a Committee of the other House, and
the minimum of classification agreed upon, and he saw no rea-
son to disturb the recommendation of the Committee, and the
decision, that had taken place upon it.
E7.ri. GROSVENOR supported the amendment, and in
lu:stration of the necessity of it, adverted to the ease of a
gentleman recently committed for an assault in the county of
Surrey. •
_ _

Loid CALTHORPE thought the classification of prisoners
much too limited.

Their Lordships divided on Lord*Suifield's amendment—
Contents, 5 ; Non-contents, 25; Majority against the amend.
ment, 20.

The Bills before the House were forwarded in their respective
stages, and their Lordships adjourned.

HOUSE OF COMMONS. '

bers present, the House adjourned till-morrow.

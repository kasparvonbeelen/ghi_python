THE MAMHEAD 'AND KENTON ESTATE, DE-
voN.--The sale of this property, by order of the Trustees,
under the will of the late Sir John Palmer Acland, Bart.,
took place at Cockram's New London Inn, Exeter, on Tues-
day week. The auctioneer was Mr. Chilcott, of Crowcombe,
near Taunton, and rarely in this neighbourhood has equal in-
terest or similar spirit of emulation been excited. The first
lot was purchased by R. W. Newman, Esq., Mamhead, for
22,800/. ; the second by S. T. Kekewich, Esq., Peamore, for
3,270/. ; the third by A. Stowey, Esq., Kenbury, for 5,2501.
The whole being at prices of from 35 to 38 years' purchase on
a fair valuation.

THE DUTCH.—The people who are considered as
possessing the least creative genius are those who have created
the most. The Dutch have created their own soil • their
hands have raised it from the sea, and have added to the ex-
tent of the Continent ; they have created their own liberty ;
their tenacity caused independence to spring from slavery.
The Dutch have created the most perfect model of mixed
constitutions, that which for two centuries had given to a small
country the opulence and power which might well belong to a
great nation. This Constitution, less vaunted than that of
England, is in all respects preferable. Europe, in fact, owes
to Holland the creation of a multitude of branches of industry.

THE BUILDERS' STRIKE.—The operatives boast
that they have funds in hand to maintain the strike for another
year, and yet continue to allow each man out of employ 123.
per week. Those men who are in regular employ were till
lately required to contribute to the weekly stock 3s. per week,
but this has now been reduced to 2s. 6d., on the avowed
ground of the flourishing state of their resources.

A pear tree, growing in the garden of Mr. John
Booth, of Meltham, near Huddersfield, which had produced a
goodly crop of fruit, was unusually early divested of its leaves,
and became to all appearance withered; however, at the com-
mencement of last month, it again budded forth in vernal
freshness, and now presents, to the astonishment of the owner,
a beautiful spectacle, being in full blossom.—Halifax Express.
DARING HIGHWAY ROBBERY IN THE HANIP-
STEAD FIELDS.—On Friday afternoon, between four and five
o'clock, a daring highway robbery was committed by two foot-
pads in the dress of excavators, in the Hampstead fields, near
the intended new Birmingham and London Railroad, on the
person of Mr. Gillford, an old gentleman between 60 and 70
years of age, and particularly nervous, residing in Grove-street,
Camden-town. From the statement of Mr. G.'s niece, a
young lady between 21 and 22, it appears that she accompanied
her uncle across the fields for the purpose of viewing the ope-
rations of the workmen in excavating the road for the intended
Birmingham and London Railway. On their return from
Kilburn they were suddenly accosted by two powerful young
men (having each of them a thick hedge-stick in his hand),
who demanded Mr. G. to instantly deliver up his watch and
purse. Mr. G. being dreadfully alarmed, implored them not
to ill-use him or his neice, and surrendered his property, con-
sisting of his watch, two gold seals and a key, and a purse
containing one sovereign and 7s. 6d. in silver, with which they
made off across the fields towards West End or Hampstead,
and effected their escape with the booty. It fortunately oc-
curred that Mr. G.'s gold watch was at his watchmaker's,
undergoing repair, worth from 401. to 501. The one stolen is
an old silver ene, lent by the watchmaker, of no particular
value.

WEST INDIES.

1 By a gentleman just arrived in this city, we are put in
Polession of the resolutions passed at a meeting of the
Assembly in the Island of Nevis on the 4th of August :
" I. That it is expedient that such effectual measures
should be adopted for the speedy and entire abolition of
slavery as may be consistent with a due regard to the per-
Inanent welfare of the slaves, the interests of their masters,
and the general safety of the community at large.
" 2. That it is expedient that the grant of 20,000,000/.
kfforded by the two houses of the British Parliament to-
bards compensation to the proprietors of the slaves, for the
tosser they may sustain by tl e operation of the measures
Proposed by his Majesty's Government, be accepted ; pro-
'ided such grant be distributed among the proprietors of
slaves in an equal proportion to be paid for every slave
throughout the colonies.
" 3. That to secure the tranquillity of this colony, and
tto obviate the danger and evils which a sudden change in
,he condition of the labouring population will propose, it
itidisPenably necessary to maintain an active and
powerful
system of police ; and this Howe receives with gratitude the announcement of his Majesty's gracious in-
tentio
to defray the expenses incidental to such an
Ca""mlittent, and to provide, upon liberal and compre-
Mive principles, for the religious and moral instruction
of the etnancipated population."â€”Bristol Journal.

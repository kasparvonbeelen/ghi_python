The Brussels Papers state that some arrangement has been
made with the Dutch Government for a transmission of cor-
respondence with the Belgians.
The express from Paris is not of much importance, as
there is no further allusion to the affairs of America, and its
contents will be fgund in another part of the paper.

His

a mail from the Mediterranean. Left Corfu 29th December,
Malta 2d inst., and Cadiz 11th inst. She brings accounts
from Greece, which are not more favourable than the last re-

Sunday next, November 30, is the first day of liberty to the
captives, and the opening of the prison doors to those that are
bound, and it will be the last day of slavery in this colony ;
and on Monday, the Ist of December, all the inhabitants of
the colony will be free.
We present our readers this day with the first report of the
proceedings of the Legislative Council. The revenue and
expenditure for 1835 were given in all their details, which oc-
cupied the whole of the Sitting. In the estimate of the
revenue of 1835, a sum of 2,0001., was granted for the sale of
lands at Graham's Town. The total income for 1835,
122,2301. 12s. 2d. ; expenditure, 1835, 121,3341. lls. lid. ;
balance, 8961. Os. 3d.

The abundance of money which prevailed during yesterday
in both the British and Foreign Markets kept the various
funds buoyant, as well as the prevailing opinion in the
well-informed circles in the City that General Jackson and
the French Government would at length come to an amicable
arrangement in the affairs of the United States. This had
the effect to keep Consols firm at the close of the market,
which left off at 9211 I for the opening for the 21st inst ; Ex-
chequer Bills closed at 259 60, ex-dividend ; India Bonds,
21 22. Consols opened this morning at the above price, with
little doing at present.
In the Foreign Market there was also an improvement, par-
ticularly in Spanish and Portuguese Stocks, which closed
firm ; Spanish, 56a ; Portuguese, 88ii. The stability in
the above foreign securities may be attributed to the arrival in
London of M. Ardouin, the contractor of the Spanish Loan,
as well as the above loan coming into the market, which was
done this morning in the house at lf premium.
Yesterday was the last day for the subscribers' letters to be
sent in for the loan.

The Spanish New Scrip has made its.appearance in the Fo-
reign Market, which has caused the Spanish Stock to recede
from 56.1 to 56t.

MEETING OF SHIPOWNERS.
(THIS DAY.)

A numerous meeting of Shipowners and others, connected
with the shipping interest of London, was held this day at
one o'clock, at the City of London. Tavern, to hear read the
report of the Committee for the year 1834.
Mr. WtoicAm was called to the Chair.

The CHAIRMAN said he regretted that it was not in hit
power to congratulate them upon any improvement in the
shipping interest, or even upon any gleam of hope of
improvement. If there had been any alteration within
the last twelve months, it had been for the worse. There
was still the same depression, the same want of profit-
able employment for the capital embarked in that perishable
property. If they were allowed a fair field of competition
with their neighbours on the Continent, they might yet hope
to derive the full benefit of those restrictions that were offered
for their advantage.—( Hear, hear.)
After the report had been read by the Secretary, Mr.
BLANCIIARD rose to move that it be adopted. He eulogised
the Committee for the intelligence and ability that were exer-
cised in drawing up the report. He expressed his hope that
the late change in his Majesty's Ministry would prove benefi-
cial to the shipping interest.
Mr. H. NELSON seconded the resolution.

Mr. Wm. YOUNG did not rise to oppose the resolution, but
he regretted that a main feature in the shipping interest—the
importation of timber in foreign vessels—had not been alluded
to. As allusions had been made to the late change in the
Government, he could only say that he did not know whether
the Whigs or Tories were most theoretically mad upon this
most important subject. He was sorry to say that neither
party were so attentive to the shipping interest as its great
importance deserved.
Mr. G. F. YOUNG, M.P., defended the Committee, and
said that upon this subject the Committee had endeavoured to
disc eminate all the information in their power, with' a view of
procuring practical amendment. _ _

- The resolution was then put and carried.
Mr. D. BARCLAY, M P., moved a vote of thanks to the
Committee, for their labours during the past year.

BAIL COURT._(THIS DAY.)

THE KING V. MARY BALDOCK.

Mr. ADOLPFIUS moved tor a rule to show cause why a cer-
tiorari should not issue to remove the proceedings in this case,
which were had before the Coroner of Bristol, to the county
of Somerset. The • application was made on affidavits,
which set forth, that some time since, an elderly
lady went to reside at the house of the prisoner, where she
died about 14 months ago. She was buried, and all was
supposed to be over. Lately her Mends learned that
she was dead, and immediately instituted an enquiry into
the circumstances, and from some communications made
by a servant, who had lately lived with Mary Baldock,
suspicion was raised that the old lady had not re-
ceived fair play. Mary Baldock was accordingly taken
into custody—the body was taken up—and a Coroner's In-
quest held The surgeon who had made a post mortem exami-
nation of it, found a quantity of arsenic in the stomach ; the re-
sult was the Jury returned a verdici of wilful murder against the
said Mary Baldock. Since that time, many songs, &c. had been
made upon the matter, and sung about the streets of Bristol.
She complained that they were much to her detriment, and
calculated to prejudice the minds of the people there to such
a degree, that she could not there get a fair trial, and there-
fore she was most anxious that it should be removed.

Rule granted.
Sir Thomas Owen was sworn in before Mr. Justice Patti-
son, as one of the Clerks of the Ordnance.

Letters were received last week, giving a very unfa-
vourable account of the health of the Princess Lieven. A
memorial has been addressed to the Emperor Nicholas, stating
the necessity of removing that distinguished lady to a mildef
clime, as soon as the severity of the season would permit.

The following curious caution was last week posted
up in a conspicuous place in the .little village of Peckham,
Surrey :—" Whereas several idle and disorderly persons have
lately made a practice of riding on an ass belonging to a gen-
tleman of this place. Now, lest any accident should happen,
notice is hereby given, that he has determined to shoot the
said ass, and cautions any person who may be riding on it at
the same time, to take special care of themselves, lest by some
unfortunate mistake, he should shoot the wrong animal."

An incendiary fire took place on Wednesday night
last, in the premises of John Aldridge, of Barton, near South-
ampton. A large barley rick was entirely consumed, and an
adjoining barn was with difficulty saved. The perpetrator has
not vet been discovered. The property was partly insured in
the °County Fire-office.
On Friday morning a fire was discovered in the
farming building of an honest and industrious farmer of the
name of William Church. at Harlington, near Luton, Bedford-
shire. The buildings were insured in the County Fire-office,
but the poor man was not insured for his stock. He has suf-
fered lately from depredations on his poultry, and as he took
some pains to bring the offender to justice, he had been
threatened by a notorious character, who is strongly suspected
to be the incendiary. A vigilant inquiry is set on foot by the
Fire-office, and it is hoped the miscreant, whoever he is, will
not escape the hands of justice.
A sympathetic ink, very far superior to any yet in
use, may be made thus :—Dissolve a small quantity of starch
in a saucer with soft water, and use the liquid like common
ink : when dry, no trace of the writing will appear upon the
paper, and the letters can be developed only by a weak solu-
tion of iodine in alcohol, when they will appear of a purple
colour, which will not be effaced until after long exposure to
the atmosphere So permanent are the traces left by the starch
that they cannot,, when dry, be effaced by India rubber.
THE LATE CHILD MURDER IN VERULAM-
BUILDINGS, GRAY'S INN.-The Benchers of Gray's Inn, in
addition to the protest which they caused to be entered on the
proceedings at the inquest, have also caused bills to be printed,
declaring the body to have been removed without their know-
ledge or concurrence, and have offered a reward of 201. for the
discovery of the murderers. The parish have also offered a
reward of 101., asserting the body to have been found in the
parish of St Andrew, Holborn. It is stated that the removal
of the body from out of Gray's Inn will form the ground of an
action in the Court of King's Bench.
SANDY BRYDON'S KILN, AND THE ASSO-
CIATED PHILOSOPHERS.—The tone of the whole discussion
fo,•cibly reminded us of a ludicrous incident that occurred to
us at landing from the steam-packet at Leith. It was night,
and it being low water in the road, we had to come about two
miles in a small boat from the packet to the shore. In this
small boat were also stowed some half-dozen London savans,
who were repairing to the Association. A flickering light
was seen in a direction north-north-west, on the Fifeshirc
horizon. "It is a true Aurora Borealis I " shouted
one philosopher ; " and Mr. Farquharson is right ; the
elevation is not more than a couple of miles. And see 1 the
beams shoot down in the manner described by Captain Parry."
" It is not an Aurora 1 " replied another, " but a highly
electrified cloud. You see the arch is abrupt, and the light
flickering and intermittent : and then it intercepts the stars,
which it would not do if it were an Aurora." A controversy
was kept up, in which others joined, as to the direction of the
meteoric phenomenon—its height, character, &c. which might
have lasted to this moment, but for an observation—made un-
consciously loud, and in a tone at once humorous and con-
temptuous, by one of the boatman—an old man—" Wed,
wed, what it is to be a feelosofer 1 A common man knows
that the light comes from Sandy Brydon's lime-kilns ; but
what it is to be a feelosoferl" Arid the grand auroreal light
turned out to be the reflection of Sandy Brydon's lime-furnace
in the sky—and nothing else I—Printing Machine.

DREAMS.—Persons are said to have had the period
of their own death pointed out to them in dreams. A Mr.
M—..., of D_, dreamed one night that he was out riding,
when he stopped at an inn on the road-side for refreshment,
where he saw several people whom he had known several
years before, but who were all dead. He was received kindly
by them, and desired to sit down and drink, which he accord-
ingly did. On quitting this strange company, they exacted a
promise from him, that he would visit them that day six weeks.
This he promised faithfully to do, and bidding them farewell,
he rode homewards. Such was the substance of his dream,
which he related in a jocular way to his friends, but
thought no more about it, for he-was a person above all kind
of superstition. The event, however, was certainly curious
enough, as well as melancholy ; for, on that very day six
weeks on which he had engaged to meet his friends at the inn,
he was killed in attempting to spring his horse over a five-
barred gate. The famous case of Lord Lyttleton is also cited
'as an example of a similar kind, but with less show of reason ;
for this case is now very generally supposed to be an imposi-
tion ; and so will almost every other of the same nature, if
narrowly investigated. At the same time, Ido not mean to
doubt that such an event, foretold in a dream, may occasion-
ally come to pass, but I would refer the whole to fortuitous
comcidence.—Macnisk on Sleep.

INSOL VtNTS' COURT-(THIS DAY.)

Stephen Furness, known as Stephen Amherst, the husband
of Mademoiselle Rosier, of the Victoria Theatre,
applied to
be discharged; he was not opposed.
The Learned CHIEFCOMMISSSONER interrogated the insol-
vent as to his affairs ; he said that he was in the theatrical 110
as well as his wife, she had realised about 2001. a year by dine'ing and teaching. Upon being asked the reason of his tip'
pearance in this Court, he said he had as much due to him. as
he owed. He had suffered great losses by his wife not being
engaged. She was engaged by Messrs. Abbot. and Egerton,
who closed the theatre for some time, and she could not take
any other engagement, as she was bound in a penalty of 2001
not to perform at any other theatre. He. claimed from them7B/. for salary. -
The CHIEF CommissioNaa inquired where Messrs. Abbot
and Egerton were.
The insolvent said he did not know, they were somewber°
•n the Continent. There had lately been a meeting of their
creditors ; he had in consequence of their failure been put to
great losses ; he ascribed his insolvency in part to them.
cistress for rent had been put into his oyster-rooms in the
Waterloo-road, which was occasioned by the closing of the
Theatre.
The insolvent was ordered to be discharged.

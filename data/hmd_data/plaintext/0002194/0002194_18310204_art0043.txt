for a Reform in Parliardent and vote by ballot. He
(Sir J. Newport) fully concurred in the propriety of Re-
fort ; he had been of that opinion from the first day he
ok his seat in the House, and every succeeding day had
confirm, d his opinion of the absolute necessity of the
measure; for, be would say, unless it were carried,
the country could not expect to derive any real benefit:
With respect to the vote by ballot, he would not say that
he was decidedly opp,sed to it, but he must confess that

the people could derive infomation.

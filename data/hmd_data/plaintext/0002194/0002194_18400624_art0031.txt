RUSSIAN SERFAGE.

The Rev. Mr. SCALES said that he had a paper to read to the
Convention upon a subject of great importance and deep interest,
and one which had already awakened great attention, and appeared
like'y to do so in a still far greater degree. It was prepared by a
gentlemen who had, resided many years in Russia, and related to
the system of serfage that was carried on in that country.
The paper was then read, and many parts of it were most en.
thusiastically cheered, and upon its being concluded--

Mr. TURNBULL said that the author was worthy of the con-
fidence of the Convention, he was a Doctor of Philosophy in
a German University, and was at that moment In London. As
there was a general resolution that all Monarchs and Govern..
meats should be addressed, he thought in the present instance
there should be a special address to the Emperor of Russia,
calling upon him to abolish the system of villeinage that existed
in that country.—(Cheers.)

After a few observations from Mr. Jamas FULLER, the paper
was directed to be referred to the Committee of the British
and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society.
. DANISH AND DUTCH SLAVERY.

Mr. ALEXANDER brought Up the Report on Danish and Dutch
slavery. The Committee had proposed a resolution for the adop.
non of the Convention. The reason why that recommendation
had been prcpc sed was, that it was thought by some of the Members
of the Committee that it would be difficult for the Convention to
adopt an address sufficiently extensive to embrace all the subject
connected with Holland and Denmark. One feature of the
slavery in Holland, :to which he did not advert on a former coca.
sion, was the fact that although there was between four and five
hundred plantations in Surinam, there were not more than 13 or
14 resident proprietors.—(Cheers.) The Hon. Gentleman con-
cluded by priposing the resolution.

The Rev. Wu. JAMES reconded the resolution, which was carried
unanimously.

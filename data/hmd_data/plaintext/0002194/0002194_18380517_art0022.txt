TO THE EDITOR OF THE SUN.

Sir,—Principle has prevailed over policy and expediency, and
shuffling " shilly shally" Ministerial manceuvres—Captain Berkeley, of
the house of Segrave, has, at twelve o'clock this day, resigned his can-
vass, finding his constituency against him, because he would not vote fr r
immediate abolition of slavery. He certainly has acted nobly—he could
not rote unless he displeased his masters the Ministers—so he preferred
the honourable course of resigning his pretensions. Noble man ! he
preferred giving up the honour to the loss of the commonalty !! Colonel
Webb is sent for post-haste; but he will not do if he is not an Aboli-
tionist. Your's, most sincerely,

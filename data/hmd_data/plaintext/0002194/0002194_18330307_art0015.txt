LONDON,
THURSDAY EVENING, MARCH 7, 1833.

It is stated this morning in the Ministerial
circles that Earl GREY is determined to press the
Irish remedial Bill with the same vigour as that
for the suppression of disturbances in Ireland,
and that he has announced his intention of re-
sisting every attempt at modification which shall
in the slightest degree affect its principle.

It is stated in letters from Rio Janeiro that
his British Majesty's ship Gib was to sail
from Rio Janeiro on the 27th ult., for the Falk-
land Islands, in order to take " sovereign pos-
session" of these islands in the name of his
Britannic MAJESTY. Another report states
that the object of the C/io's visit is merely to
examine into their present condition, and report
thereon. The first statement, however, is likely
to be correct, for we remember that about six
months ago, when a Lieutenant of the British
Navy, who had been appointed as an agent for
the disposal of land, by the soi disant Governor
of the Falkland Islands, applied to Lord Go-
DERICH to know whether he could proceed
safety in the business of his agency, his
Lordship replied that he could not do so, as the
British Government laid claim to the islands in
question. The person who now holds them is
a Spaniard, who had large claims upon the
Buenos Ayrean Government, which it dis-
charged by making him a grant of possessions to
which it had no title.

It is quite true, we understand, as stated in
the city article of the Times, that an attempt is
making by a particular party in the House of
Commons, to force Ministers to some change
in the currency ; but it does not appear that a
club is to be formed for this purpose. Mr.
THOMAS ATTWOOD and his brother MAT-
THIAS, two gentlemen whose political opinions
are so widely different that they were never
known to agree on any one point except the
currency, are at the head of this party. Mr.
THOMAS ATTWOOD, it is said, some time ago,
addressed a long paper to Earl GREY on this
subject, and he has been indefatigable in his
efforts to increase the number of his party, but
he has not been very successful.

The Morning Herald, alluding to the recent
interview between Lord GODV.RICH and the
Committee of West India Planters, says—

" It is generally current in the city, that the West
India Deputation, at the recent interview with Lord
GonEßicH, did not have any actual measure placed before
them, but were required to furnish their opinions upon
certain subjects relative to the slaves, which they have
since sent it]. The intended plan of Ministers how-
ever, rumoured to he—ist. The immeriiat: abolition of
slavery in the colonies. 2d. The compensation to the
slave owner, at a fixed rate per head, for every slave.
3d. The raising of a lean for such compensation, to b^
paid off in 30 years. 4th. The manumitted slave to be
compelled by the magistrates to work five days out of the
seven, except when in crop, when they would work for
six days. sth. Two days' amount of wages to be deducted
and paid into the compensation fund, it being considered
the remaining three or four days, as the case may be, as to
in crop or not, would he sufficient for the support of the
slave. It is said the West India body are anxious to learn
the extent of the compensation, upon which their approval
will mainly rest. We give the above without vouching
for its correctness, merely stating it has been ►mentioned in
respectable circles."

This is merely a repetition of what we stated
in The Sun a few days ago, from a source on
which we had reason to place reliance. We are
now enabled to add, that although the West India
Committee has expressed great readiness to accede
to the principle of the abolition of slavery, they
are not satisfied with some of the details of the
Ministerial plan ; and, in consequence of their
representations on the subject, Lord GODERICH
has consented to modify it. ft is expected that
in the course of a fortnight or three weeks, his
Lordship will have made such progress with his
measure as to be able to make a communication

to Parliament respecting it. We have not yet
heard whether the amount of compensation to
the slave owners is to be at a fixed rate per head,
without regard to locality, or to be determined
by Commissioners, according to their value in
the different islands.

A return has been laid before the House of
Commons, on the motion of Mr. ATTWOOD,
showing the sums paid in and drawn out monthly
by the Commissioners for the redemption of
the National Debt, on account of Savings'
Banks, and Friendly Societies, from the 28th
January, 1832. It appears that, up to the 9th
February, 1833, the total amount of principal
paid in was 761,3681., whilst the amount drawn
out was 1,264,1181. 7s. 7d., being a difference
of about half a million. We are, however, in-
clined to hope that this result does not arise
from any great deterioration in the condition of
the contributors to Savings' Banks and Friendly
Societies. The foundation of our hope is, that
we perceive the greater part of the drawing out
took place during the agitation of the Reform
Bill, and chiefly when fears were entertained by
all but ourselves of a Tory Ministry coming into
power. This will be made clear by the follow-
ing extract from the account :

The alarm was at its maximum during the
ten days the Whig Administration was out of
office. From that time the account shows a
gradual increase in the sums paid in, till they
amounted, for the four weeks ending 26th of
January last, to 111,7011., and for the two
weeks ending February 9, to 72,4801., which,
supposing the remaining two weeks are equally
favourable, will give, for the last month,
144,9601. The principal paid out decreased
every month in a corresponding manner, with
the exception of the January month, which pre-
sents a slight increase upon that which preceded it,
being 43,6661. 17s. 4,1., whilst that ending 29th
December presented a sum drawn out of only
31,881/. 12s. 6d. Confidence, however, seems
to have been quickly restored, for the two weeks
ending 9th February present us only with a sum
of 12,965/. drawn out. The shock experienced
by the fund in the spring has never, however,
been completely got over ; and it is to be feared
that the poorer contributors, having been fright-
ened into drawing out their hard-earned savings,
were afterwards tempted to spend the greater part
of them. This indicates, however, but a small
portion of the sum of loss and human misery
which may be laid to the door of the reckless
conduct of the Tories.

EVENING EDITION.

A T a MEETING held at KENNINGTON-
COMMON this Evening,
(
It, _ Captain ACK ERLEY in the Chair,
was proposed by Mr. La BLOND, and seconded by Mr.
GRANBY, and carried,
That the true object of this out-door meeting is on behalf of
liberty for the dear children in slavery, through the agency of the
nlis-called " Children's Friend Society" and those children of a
larger growth in prison at home ; to equalize the laws in their
regard, like as unto the scales of justice offered by nature for
tnan's guidance, to preserve what is good in the law, and dis-
card what is evil ; to support, to maintain that elective form of
Government, for the cultivation and allotment of the land, in
a way most conducive to the public voice ; for filling the belly,
to the comfort of the cottager, and to the public well-being of
the people individually as one, and collectively as the many,
without regard to religious creed or colour.
It was proposed by Mr. GEoacr, and seconded by Mr. PETE;
and carried,
That in the present crisis of National distress, where all
the monied-wealth of the upper and middle classes are in
direct opposition—in sworn combination against the native
rights of the industrious, their suffering fellow-countrymen,
this assembled host, with up-lifted hands, in the face of God.
from this moment constitutes itself into a " National Union,"
with like intentions as their relatives in Birmingham, to support
the National Convention, as long as honesty marks their ac-
tions, to insist on the complete restoration of the old national
liberty of vote in y.e people—a return to their parents of the
Poor kidnapped children, under false-articled indentures, now
beyond the seas ' • also to demand—once for all--of the Queen,
whether she and her pensioned relatives are for the Charter or
against it ; because if not with us, the people, they are
against us.
Signed this day. 27th May, 1839, on behalf of the meeting,
CHARLES H. ACKERLY.
The National Union of the Working Classes adjourned to
Monday next, the 3d of June, 1839, with the understanding that
the aforesaid resolutions be transmitted to the Secretary of
State for the Home Department. C. H. A.

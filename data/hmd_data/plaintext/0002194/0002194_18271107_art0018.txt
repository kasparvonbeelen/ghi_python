these are matters happily within the power,
certainly within the justice, of Parliament, to r!,

application to Parliament for any purposes wni,t,
they might deem requisite on the subject. It can

such an application might be deemed emine_„nti,
useful—cases in which the representatives of tro-t
lies who have acquired property in Englon`go
elsewhere, and who have returned at a v-if
mature age to those islands, are certainly s'ee,,
fit objects to be relieved from a state of int of
minable slavery ; for a return to a condition :0
slavery must operate upon them and others, r t
at all under similar circumstances, with an tap',
severity; .and at any rate, the humanity of PA

effect, if the colonists themselves should Dee

Lord STOWELL, after-Mr. Dodson had conellitiejar
added a few observations, in which his LordshiP,,, ,e
clAred, that his decision was the result of coagroj

from close consideration of statutes. His Lorar,
Orr
accordingly pronounced against the appeal, al,
ing the sentence of the judge in the court be
with costs.
The case was not remitted, owing to a quei

some idiom, some dress, or some custom of common life, re-

THE FIRST PART OF THE
PICTORI AL HISTORY of PALESTINE.
By the EDITOR of the PICTORIAL BIBLE.
The main object of the present Work is to relate every event
of interest or importance in the political, social, military,
physical, and religious History of the country called PALES-
TINE, from the most remote ages to the times in which we
live. It will thus be, in the largest sense,
A HISTORY OF PALESTINE,
and not merelyof the Hebrew nation ; but seeing that it is only
its connection, and the consequences of its connection, with
the history of the Hebrew people, which has rendered this
small country of historical importance, it is also intended that
the present volume should be complete as
A HISTORY OF THE JEWS;
not leaving them, as most histories do, when they were utterly
cast forth from their old possessions; but while, on the one
hand, the history of the country is still continued, on the other
pursuing the people into all the places of their dispersion.
THE PHYSICAL HISTORY OF PALESTINE,

or an account of the physical Geography and various Products
at.d characteristics of the country, will present a feature pecu-
liar to this Work.

The SI, nod Engravings. which will be very numerous, and
in many instances from original Sketches of the Scenery of the
Cand, will be executed in the first style of the art. The
subjects of these engravings will be strictly illustrative ; being
representations of actu 11 scenery, costume, manners, monu-
ments, and objects of natural history—in some instances com-
bined into a picture or group, but never exhibiting anything
merely fanciful.
The " Pictorial History of Palestine" will form two hand-
some volumes, of the size of the " Pictorial Bible," to which
work it will form a Supplementary Companion.
London : Charles Knight and Co., 2'2, Ludgate-street.

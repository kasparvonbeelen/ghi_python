SUPPLY OF SUGAR.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE SUN.
Liverpool, June 2, 1840.
Sir,—l have read, with much satisfaction, the letter
of " A Liverpool Merchant," which appeared in your
columns yesterday. He omits the notice of a circum-
stance recorded in the Colonial Magazine, that,
whereas the consumption of sugar in Britain was 301 b.
a head in 1800, it has now fallen to 16. This is start-
ling, if true.
Allow me to suggest, that if insurmountable diffi-
culties deter the Government from admitting foreign
slave-grade sugar. that, the country might be relieved of
its dearth of this necessary by allowing duty to be paid
on the Refined Sugars and Treacle from the bonded
refineries, which, being of British manufacture, cannot
surely bear the odious taint of slavery. The benefit to
the refiners in their present depression, especially at the
outports, would be great. The duties might be 365.
on their loaf-sugar, 28s. to 328. on their bastards, and
lOs. to • 12s. on their. treacle. I believe this scheme
would remove many objections that are urged against a
change of our sugar system ; the advantage to te con-
sumers would be incalculable, as lump would be sold at
d price so low that the poorest could indulge himself
with refined sugar, as is universally the case with the
more fortunate inhabitants of continental kingdoms.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
ANOTHER LIVERPOOL MERCHANT.

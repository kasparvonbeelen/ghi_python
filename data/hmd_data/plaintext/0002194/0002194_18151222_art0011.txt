From the Port Royal and St. David's Moun-
tains, e. learn that prodigidni havoc has been
committed Among the different coffee proPe'rties
there ; numbers of valuable works and houses en-
tirely destroyed, and others seriously damaged.,---
Among the plantations which have suffered !e-
-rerely in the fornier parish, are Pleasant Hill,
Clifton; Resource, Robertsfield,, Green -Vale,
lupewell, Coot-Shade; Berwick, and S.c..veral
others ; and in The latter,• Chesterfield, Mount-
Tivint. Brook-Lodge, Mount-Sinai, River-Head,.
Sun -Vale, Radnor, Abbey-Green, Somerset,
Windsor-Porest, Eccleston, and others.

We lament to state, too, that on some pro-
perties many netroes have lost their lives,. and
we particularly regret to Mention, that Mr. John
Smith, Collecting: Constable of St David's, with
part of his families_and 'negroes,, and .Mr. Thomas
Williams, Pound i{eeper of the.same parish, were
carried r-flti-av and drowned by the impetuosity of
11rallahs Hive' r : the bodies of both these Geutle,
men have been -found and interred.: Scarcely a
net roc-house in the :thrive monnti;hl4, or in those
,-,(4 St. Andrew and St. Catherine, is left standinv,.
The stone-bridge ,erecting at the Botanic Garden
ie destroyed', u'ot a vestige of it to be seen,—
Equally melancholy neconnts have been received,
~from the parishes Of Sr. Thomas in the East, Port
land, St. George, and St. glary: It gives us
plea-
su however; to add, that the North-side pa,
rishes from St. Ann's,alo,rnwards, and those to.
ice card, have not 'suffered iii the same driailfo
degree Its those we have- Mentioned.

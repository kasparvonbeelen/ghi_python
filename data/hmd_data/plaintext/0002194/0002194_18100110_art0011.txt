WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 10, 1810.

' The French Papers and those under French in-
fluence have lately given very contradi&ory accounts
respecting the number of troops which have been
sent into, and are on their march for Spain, These
contradictions are very probably intentional, but we
have strong reason to believe that BUONArAItTE has
recently felt himself under the necessity of; Making
some material changes with respect to the description
of force which he meant principally to employ in the
subjugation of Spain. There can be no doubt that
t was his intention to .detach the greaterpart of the
i.ontingents of the Confederation of the Rhine into
Spain, by which plan a double abject would be at-
tained—hi:s views against Spain would be, prothoted,
and all danger of opposition to, his will in Germany
would be removed. But -we have strong grounds for
believing thatBUONAPARTE has been under the ne-
cessity of giving up his plan. We have been fa-
voured by a Gentleman •who is just arrived from
the Continent, and who has lately passed through
the territories of some of the principal Princes
of the Confederation of the Rhine, with some in-
teresting information upon this subjc4l.‘ , He states,
that in Bavaria, Saxony, Wirtemberg, and Baden,

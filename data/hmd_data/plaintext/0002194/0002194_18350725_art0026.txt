THE FUNDS.-(THIS DAY.)

• CITY, 7'WEITE O'CLOCK.
We are again without any arrivals of consequence this morn-
ing, owing, no doubt, to the Easterly winds. We have only
one French, and one Hamburg mail, with one arrival of ship
letters from Jamaica.

.....
The monied interest in the City has been for some time past
continually kept on the qui vice by repeated reports, that every
day we may expect the official notice from the Treasury of the
West India Loan—even now it is stated that the particulars
have transpired—that Ministers will require the whole of the
twenty millions, and the bidding is to take place in the 31 per
Cents. ; and that they will assign 100 Consols for every 100
pounds Money, with a portion of the 31- per Cents.
Yesterday afternoon, upon the above report, the Consol
Market looked heavy, although they left off at 901 g for
the account, and opened this morning 89i 90; heavy
market, attributed to the Loan. Exchequer Bills, 29 31.
India Bonds, 10 12. Bank Stock, 215 216.
The Foreign Market, which was buoyant in the early part of
the day, turned heavy towards the afternoon, owing to the re-
port of the West India Loan, and closed at reduced prices.
The following are the quotations this morning :—Spanish
Bonds left off yesterday at 511 now 501. Spanish Scrip
closed at 84 at present 94- discount. Portuguese Bonds left
off 91+ 1-1-, now 901 91. Three per Cents. closed at 601 61, at
present 591 60.

HALF-PAST ONE.
The topic of conversation this morning, in the City,
generally relates to the approaching West India Loan ; but,
to the present hour, we have no official intimation on the sub-
ject. The prevailing opinion is, that it will be received the
beginning of next week.
Consols have been during most part of the morning at 891.,
90 for the Account. In the early part of the day 50,000/.
were sold, since which no operation of consequence has taken
place. Exchequer Bills 29 30 ; Indian Bonds 10 premium ;
Bank Stock 215 ; India Stock 2551.
The Foreign Market continues heavy, with little doing;
Spanish Bonds 50-; Spanish Scrip 93 discount ; Portuguese
91:1- 91 ' - Three per Cents. 59i. 60 ; Dutch 21 per Cents.
54 .3.; Columbian 361 371 ; Mexican 361 372.

TREASURY CHAMBER.

The following from Lord Melbourne and Mr. Spring Rice
was posted at the Stock Exchange ;—" I beg to inform you,
and to request you will make it known in the usual manner,
that on Wednesday next, at 11 o'clock, I shall be ready to
see any gentlemen who may be desirous of contracting for a
Loan under the provisions of an Act passed in the 3d and 4th

TALES OF TIIE RAMAD'HAN.---Eastern stories
have always been popular, and the above is a new series, from
the pen
of Mr. St. John (who has lately returned from Egypt
and Turkey), which are likely to throw fresh lustre over this
graceful and brilliant class of fiction. The stories are supposed
to be narrated during the fast of the Ramad'han, that Eastern
Lent, when some pastimeis absolutely necessary to beguile the
weary season of denial. The work is said to be crowded with
adventures, and glowing pictures of manners in far countries ;
and over all is thrown that hueof romance and enchantment
peculiar to narratives appertaining to Arabia and other parts
of the Oriental World.

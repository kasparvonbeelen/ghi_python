much more likely that the wrath of the Cabinet

of St.Petersburgh will be excited by the insolence
of the Porte than that that insolence should have
the effect of increasing its moderation. The ex-
hibition of Am PAcHA's head on the walls of the
Seraglio was admirably calculated to deprive the
Turks of the last spark of reason. Supposing
the Porte to have been disposed to yield to
Russia, nothing more impolitic than this exhibi-
tion could have been determined on,—certain as
it was to make the current of popular intoxica-
tion run counter to the policy of the Divan. It
seems to indicate, therefore, that the Government
itself is as infatuated as its subjects; and that it
would rather stimulate the courage and confidence
of its subjects, than prepare their minds for the hu-
miliation of submission to the dictates of Christen-
dom; the Janissaries and the populace of Constant',
nople accordingly cry out for battle. They
affirm that the war on which they are eager to
enter is predestined and they rely with implicit
faith on the immediate interposition of their
Prophet for its triumphant termination. The
Jews were deceived by a similar infatuation even
while the battering rams of the Romans shook
the towers of Mount Zion ;' and the Greeks i❑
Constantinople fell victims to the same super-
stitious credulity when the fearful hosts of Ma-
homed 11. surrounded them in 1453 in Constan-
tinople. The Crescent has now had its day.
The ignorance and superstition which gave it
stability are disappearing before the march
of Europea❑ intelligence. The banner is raised
against it which must be victorious. The tide
of victory, knowledge, and civilization must roll
eastward with a steady and irresistible force,
sweeping before it darkness and slavery. The
whole system of Mahomedan dominion in Europe
has been the monstrous production of fraud and
violence,—a daring and impious usurpation of
the attributes of JF;.`OVAH,—the rod, for a time,
in his hand, to scourge guilty nations. But the
rod is itself, when it has answered its purpose,
destined to be " thrown into the flames."—
The foundation of Islamism is slavery, cap-
tivity, and chains to the vanquished. Esta-
blished by the sword,—maintained by the sword,
—by the sword it must fall. "He that leadeth
into captivity shall go into captivity,—he that
killeth with the sword must be killed by the
sword," is the just and unalterable anathema of
the MOST HIGH, applicable to every system of
fraud and tyranny, civil or superstitious, but in a
particular Manner applicable tot and seemingly

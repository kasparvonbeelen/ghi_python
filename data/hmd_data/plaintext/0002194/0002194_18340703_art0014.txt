THE FUNDS.-(THIS DAY.)

CITY, TWELVE O'CLOCK.
We have only two foreign arrivals of mails this morning, the
French and Ostend, but no ship letters.
The Barbadoes papers state that the House of Assembly
of that colony, on the 3d of May, agreed to the following re-
ply to a message from his Excellency the Governor, respecting
the transfer of the power of punishing slaves from the master
to the magisterial body :
" The House of Assembly respectfully beg leave to acknow-
ledge the receipt of his Excellency's message, to the 9th inst.,
submitted to the Hague, suggesting that as the act for the
abolition of slavery would come into full operation on the Ist
of August, it would be extremely desirable if the legislature
would immediately pass a short bill, abrogating the power of
inflicting punishment on slaves by owners and others, and
transferring that power to the magistrates of towns and
parishes.
" In reply to which the house begged to inform his Excellency,
that as no slave act empowers owners to prefer complaints to
magistrates against their slaves for misconduct, instead of ex-
ercising their own authority, the house had reason to hope
that recourse will be had to such authority in all flagrant cases ;
but as a general measure, the house conceives that it would
not be practicable unless the magistrates of the island were
placed on a different footing, by being remunerated with sa-
laries instead of fees, a change much to be desired, but which
the advanced state of the;session prevents their entering upon."

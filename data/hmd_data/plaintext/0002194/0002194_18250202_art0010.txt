lA)NDON,
WEDNESDAY EVENING, FEB. 2, 1825.

We have received the Paris Papers of Sunday.
Some of the Ministerial Journals mention a re-
port that news, unfavourable to the continuance
of the general peace, had been received from the
Courts to which communications had been sent
relative to the recognition of the South American
States by England. We are not at all appre-
hensive that the peace of Europe will be
disturbed : •and we have reason to believe
that the Continental Powers will not in
any way interfere with the policy of our
Government in regard to those States.—
The avowed Ministerial Journal, the Eloik,
makes no allusion to this news, but simply de-
clares, that it believes there is no foundation
whatever for the assertion, that the King of the
NiPtherlands is about to negociate treaties
of commerce with all the South American
Btates• The conduct of that Government,
however in sending Commissioners to South
America, and the language held by those Com-
missioners clearly sinew the nature of its inten-
tions ; and there is little doubt but the Govern-
ment of the Netherlands will at no distant period
imitate the example of this country. Reason-
hig upon the possibility of any hostile mea-
sures on the part of the Holy Alliance and
Prance against England on account of her re-
cognition of South American Independence, the
Constilutionne/ says, that it is only by uniting to
dispute with England the empire of the sea, which
gives the dominion of the world, that the Holy
Alliance can inspire this country with terror.
The Journalist then endeavours to spew that we
are fully prepared for the contest. " Dreading
this union", he says, " England has excited rival-
ties on the Continent. She cannot see without dis-
quietude the powerful league formed by the Sove-
reigns who have conquered by her intrigues and
her gold : she must know that chimerical fears
do not conceal real projects, and that sooner
or later a great and noble ambition would endea-
vour to wrest from her the means of her power,
which seems created only to injure the rights of
all nations. When she saw the developement of
this alliance, however, she took courage, and
while it was performing the duty of Police Mi-
nisters of the old Continent, she promoted the
emancipation of the New. She has thus pro-
fited by the time which was lost by Congresses
in keeping people in slavery, instead of stipu-
lating for their liberty and interests. Her re-
serve and her protestations against the prin-
ciple of our armed interference in the affairs
of Spain must have made her policy vi-
sible as to her future designs. By our
triumph in Spain, we have separated Spain
from her Colonies, and have promoted the
views of England. The Cabinet of London on
this occasion acted with frankness and did not d is-

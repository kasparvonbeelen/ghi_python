HIS MAJESTY'S HEALTH.

The following is the Bulletin issued this day-
-46 Windsor Castle, June 22.
" The KING bas passed a good night.
" His MAJESTY'S cough and expectoration continue.
" HENRY HALFORD,
" MATTHEW J. TIERNEY."

By Express from Paris, this morning, we
have a date of yesterday morning, and letters of
Sunday evening. An ordinance of the KING
had appeared respecting the electoral rights, by
which the Colleges are directed to assemble as
follow :—The Colleges of the Arrondissements
on the 12th of July, and Colleges of Depart-
ments on the 19th. The Ordinance of 16th

May is revoked, as far as the above departments
are concerned.
It was rumoured at Paris on Sunday evening,
that a Royal Ordinance would shortly appear,
whereby the Council-General of Marine and
Commerce would be recognized and established
on a much wider basis, and more favourable to
the public interests. By the accounts from
Florence, by this conveyance, we learn that
Count CAPO D'ISTRIAS had declared the Island
of Hydra a free port for five years. Other letters
give a melancholy picture of the state of Epirus,
and the increasing vexation it suffered from the
Albanians who were divided into two parties.
One of them was headed by IMIR PACHA, and
the second by SELICTAR PODA. IMIR PACHA
is actually shut up in the fortress of Janina,
while the Albanians, who are in the town,
were murdering and pillaging the unfortunate
Greek inhabitants. These murders are not con-
fined to Janina, as the surrounding country, and
particularly Zageri, are equally suffering, whole
families being reduced to slavery. The PACIIA
and the Albanians were constantly demanding
money, and ransacked every place in the hope
of finding it. This account is confirmed by
letters from Belgrade of the 2d instant, which
add, that the SULTAN had sent Commissioners
to restore order, but it was thought the spirit of
revolt had so extended itself that it would not
easily be put down. He had also addressed a

circular to the Pachas, calling upon theta to put
down the insurrectionary spirit. It is affirmed
that the present disorders in Albania differ very
much from those previously displayed in revolts
in the Turkish provinces, and that a strong
spirit of independence has shown itself. The
troops had entirely refused obedience to the
Pachas, and had been joined by many Greek
adventurers. From the small number of Turkish
troops in Albania no effectual resistance could

be offered, and it was said a strong corps was
actually on the march to attack Lanova,
which, situated on the frontiers of Bosnia and
Macedonia, was of great importance to the
future operations of the revolters. A letter by

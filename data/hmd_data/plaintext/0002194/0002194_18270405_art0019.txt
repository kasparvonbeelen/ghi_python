by Hector St. John, a respectable Pensylvanian farmer
" I was," says this gentleman, " not long since, invited t°
dine with a planter, who lived three miles from
where he then resided. I was leisurely travellieg alougf.
attentively examining some peculiar plants which I hs°
collected, w hen all at once I felt the air strongly agitated'
though the day was perfectly calm and sultry ; I ;mote
diately cast my eyes towards the cleared ground, fr°°
which I was but a small distance, in order to see whetho
it was not occasioned by a sudden shower, when at SW'S
instant a sound resembling a deep rough voice, uttered,
I thought, a few inarticulate monosyllables. Alarmed aw
surprised, I precipitately looked all around, when I per'
ceived, at about six roods distance, something resembling
cage suspended to the limbs of a tree, all the branches °'
which appeared covered with large birds of prey, flutterid
about, and anxiously endeavouring to pitch upon the cage'
Actuated by an involuntary action of my hands, mere 00
by any design of mind, I fired at them: they all flew to $
short distance, with a most hideous noise, when, horrid 0,
think, and painful to repeat, I perceived a negro suspend
in the cage, and left there to expire. The birds had ti'
ready picked out his eyes ; his cheek bones were bare ; 11/0
arms had been attacked in several pluses, and his bodf
seemed covered with wounds.

tionless. The living spectre, though deprived of his
could still distinctly hear, and in his uncouth dialect, beg',
ged me to give him some water to allay his thirst. A shell
ready fixed to a pole, which had been used by some negroes,
presented itself to me, I filled it with water, and with trent'
Kling hands, I guided it to the quivering lips of the sufferer.
Urged by irresistible thirst, he endeavoured to meet it, so
he instinctively guessed its approach, " Tanke you, whin
man, tanke you ; pute some poison, and give me."--110V
long have you been hanging there ? I asked him, " Two
days—and me no die—the birds—the birds--ah me, ah
me." Oppressed with the reflection which this shocking
spectacle afforded me, I mustered strength enough to vvidi‘
away, and soon reached the house at which I intended to
dine; there I heard that the reason of this slave being thus
punished, was on account of his having killed his roaster
or overseer of the plantation. They told me, that self-
preservation rendered such executions necessary, and sup'
ported the doctrine of slavery with.the arguments generallf,
made use of, to justify the practice, with the repetition of
which, I shall not trouble you at present.— Galway Iry

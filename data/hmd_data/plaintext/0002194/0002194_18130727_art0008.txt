However, as we find, that, by some "extrac. L-.
nary good: fortune," the gallant )(Po, with his
brave band, and a more valiant picked ftirce nev•!n.
left the shores Of Britain to chastise a presamp-
tuous enemy, is confessed, even by these clip:
mourers 'to have got to the right place in time and
stitlicient strength this season, we shall for the
presestt leave them to their gloomy anticipations
of SUCCCSS from the efforts of that gallant Expe-
dition, and tell them that there is po good fo.lune
in the case which rests on the slicer industry and
exertion of our reviled Ministers—it is . •

All chance, direction which they cannot see.

The Corunna Mail, to which we alluded yester-
day, and the contents Of which we have now in-
serted, brings down the information from that
port to the 18th, hut conveys no very 'recent or
material news from the Pyrenees. The sieges of
Pamplona and Sebastian appear now to be regu-
larly commenced ; 15,000 men arc employed
.the former, and the batteries which had
been erected against this strong place began
to play on the 6th. Other heavy guns
have been landed at Reba, and, new and more
powerful means of mock Will Of course shortly be
employed, from wliieb; and the dispirited state of
the gtirrison, We hope we arc not too sanguine in
anticipating its speedy reduction. ' The, late of St.
Sebastian could not, we imagine, he long delayed.
--Of the army with which the intrusive King
tried the battle at Vittoria, and which on that
memorable day consisted of 60,0004r00t trod 7000
hdrse, we are told, only 17,000 of the former, and
3000 of theiatter remain—the rest have been sa,
crifteed on thealt.Ar of ruthless tyranny and law-
less ambition ! •

With regard to other points announced in these
Papers, it is more than probable that the zeal and
enthusiastn of. the Cormina Editors outrun their
intelligence. The entrance into Bayonne, and
the Deputation mentioned from that City, are, we
fear, only creatures of the brain—excusable, in-
deed, because the brain is heated frmn an honest
and patriotic heart.

The few circumstances stated, relative to the
retreat of SUCH ET from the Xucar arc more in-
teresting:
His destruction of the bridges, mining
of the roads, and dismantling of the batteries, is
a clear demonstration that he never contemplates
a return, but gives up the cause of French do-.
minion in Spain as utterly lost and hopeleSs.
He is followed by many pursuers, but they do
nut seem to. he close enough at his heels,
though .there is a paragraph which would in-
duce us to think that rAto had come up with
and attacked the rear under 1-Imusre. We
confess we shall he disappointed if these des-
perate oppressors shall have the. dexterity
to effect their escape without tasting the ven-
geance of acountry they have so horribly mangled
and filled with blood. This, howeVer, is
,only. a
natural feeling; all our political desires are &ids
fied by the glorious .regolts of that immortal
achievement which has rescued and liberated
a great nation from the fangs of despotism
and the miseries of slavery. It would have
pleased us that such monsters as could exe-
cute that refinement of diabolism by which were
murdered the wretched peasants and fishermen of
Guiteria, should have tasted the ' punishment
their atrocious crimes deserved, and. that
Stivturr himself should have been called to
answer for the massacre of hundreds of Ivo,
men and children. on the' beach of Tarragona;
but amid the mighty sources 'of gratulation we
poqsess, SVC will not repine even should the in-

Music.—The Jamaica planters were formerly
accustomed to maintain that the harpy condition of the
negroes in a state of slavery was attested by their passion
for dancing and singing. We do not know whether the
white inhabitants of the West Indies imbibed a love o
song from the sable sons of Africa, but our attention has
been called to some excellent specimens of music com
posed and published by Mr.. Francis Egan, of Kingston,
Jamaica, two of which are now before us. The first, en-
titled " Oh I water for me," will soon become as popular
among the tea-totallers on this and the other side of the
Atlantic, as " God save the Queen" at a Cabinet dinner;
and the " Tear," from the pen of Samuel Rogers, well
adapted to thaw the froien sensibilities of the most obdu
rate old bachelor. The young ladies are under a thousand
obligations to Mr. Egan, for thus rendering them more
completely invincible.
IMAGINATION OF FACTS.—There are many
things in prose as well as poetry which we read and un-
derstand sufficiently well for the comprehension of the ge-
neral scope and tendency of the given work, yet which
we never realise to our imaginations as facts, or supposed
facts, without the ingress of certain adventitious circum-
stances inducing a home-searching view of the literal
truth. This is not only the case in reading books, but in
our affairs of life, and knowledge of actual things. We
believe, know, and understand very well that a certain
number of men are shipwrecked, murdered, and starved
every year ; but let us be suddenly called upon to imagine
a drowned, murdered, or starved man lying before our
feet, and we shall feel that our previous impressions were
vague idealisms of the fact, and that we never were con-
scious that the thing was a reality. But, in proportion as
people possess and exercise the power of calling the
mental facultis onward to the imaginary realization, or
inward ♦ision of the embodied truth, so is the depth
and breadth of their comprehension and sympathy with
men and books. Our dormancy in realising known or
admitted facts will become apparent to every one Rho ex-
amines himself on the point—Monthly Chronicle.

TRICKS OF HORSE-DEALERS.—A friend of
mine was once done in the following way. He repaired,
with more cash than wisdom, to the stables of a horse-
dealer, and having selected a nag that he thought would
suit his purpose, demanded the price. The dealer, per-
ceiving his customer to be a little green, immediately asked
about 15 pounds more than he meant take, and finding that
the price was not objected to, began no doubt to think
himself an egregious ass for not having demanded more.
He therefore requested my friend to look round his
stables, and to try some other horses, and while thus em-
ployed, dispatched a message to a confederate, who
quickly arrived as a stranger, and unhesitatingly bought
the horse first brought out at all the money that was asked
for him, declaring be bad never picked up such a bargain.
In this assertiat he was strenuously backed by the
dealer, who regretted that my friend had not decided at
once upon taking se cheap a horse himself, and added in a
whisper, " Offer him five pounds for his bargain, Sir; I
know something about him, he'll sell." " Upon this hint
he spake," and to some purpose too, for he of course got
the horse, and learned a lesson in dealing into the bargain
—his purchase turning out, when minus the ginger and
threats of the coper's yard, a very sorry beast indeed.—
Old Sporting Magazinefor September.
TRICKS OF PARIS.—The day I purchased
them (bracelets) was marked by the following singular
occurrence. I was walking across one of the bridges in
Paris, when a well-dressed man suddenly threw himself
over the parapet into the Seine. Fortunately he fell in a
place where the water was not very deep, and he was
speedily rescued from his perilous predicament. A crowd
immediately surrounded him—l amongst the rest. He
opened his eyes, and his words were Ma enfans—mes
pauvres enfans I—My children, my poor children 1' These
piteous exclamations moved me, and I immediately gave
the man a couple of Napoleons, they being all the money
I had about me. " Lord bless you, sir," said an English-
man, whom the occurrence had also attracted to the spot,
" he's done that already three times this week. He regu-
larly drowns, or poisons, or stabs himself four or five times
every week." " Good God !" said I; " what does he do
that for ? Is he mad ?" " Mad I no," returned the man :
" he is a devilish clever fellow on the contrary, and picks
up a good deal of money in this way. It's an excellent
business. He lives better by dying five. or six times a
week than Ido by working hard." " What ! is he an im-
postor, then ?" cried I, naturally indignant at the gross
manner in which I had been impoad upon. " That's a
harsh word, sir," answered the man ; "but he's something
like it, though."—Pickwick Abroad.

I went this morning to see the specimens of
Daguerrotype exhibited by M. Giroux in the Rue de Coq
St. Honore. They are very beautiful, and entirely unlike
those which have been exhibited in England. I cannot
give you a better description of them than by stating that
they resemble very much the appearance which the objects
have upon the table of the camera obscura itself Every
thing is represented minutely and clearly ; but unless the
plate be brought near the eye, there is little effect: whereas
the specimens shown in England are pictures like any
others at a certain distance. M. Giroux is making a fine
harvest of the exclusive privilege of selling the apparatus
which has been granted to him by M. Daguerre, for he
charges 425 f. for a case containing the necessary mate-
rials, and boasts of having sold 150 cases during last week.
As the cost of a complete set of materials cannot be to him
more than 100 E, he must have cleared more than two
hundred and fifty pounds sterling in a single week. The
charge for one of the plates purchased separately is 6f.,
and in the event of failure in taking the objects it may be
cleaned fifteen times, so that it is not likely ever to be a
decided failure. With skill, however, the experiment is
generally successful in two or three operations. In each
of the cases which he sells there are only six plates for as
many pictures.—Paris Correspondent.

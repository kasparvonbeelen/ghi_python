METROPOLITAN POLITICAL

SUMMARY.

The Courier of this evenirg, discussing Mr. O'Connell's
speech last night in the House of Commons, remarks as
follows A very fertile topic with Mr. O'Connell is
the injustice done to Ireland by the inferior quality of
her Reform Act, as compared with that of England.
Would Mr. O'Connell wish them to have the English
Reform Act, with all its faults, transferred to Ireland?
The Schedule. B BoroughS, almost as rotten now as in
1829 ? the pauper freeholder, and the sorry slavery of the
tenant at will ? There arc advantages, no doubt, in the
English Act which have been withheld from Ireland, but
there are defecta in it, the infliction of which has been
spared to Ireland. The very character of the representa-
tives chosen by the Irish constituency, is a sufficient reply
to the delusive sophism to which Mr. O'Connell is
never weary of returning,"
The Globe inclines to the opinion that the Lords will
pass the Portuguese Slave Trade Bill, which in its first
form, they rejected the other evening, observing :—" The
course their Lordships in their wisdom may be pleased to
take, in order to extricate themselves from the dilemma in
which they have involved themselves, remains to be seen.
The immediate condemnation of their conduct in rejecting
the former Bill, not merely by the Members of the Commons
who are opposed to the principles and policy in which a
majority of their Lordships rejoice, but by the most distin-
guished of their own party in the House of Commons,
may, possibly, induce them to pause ere they, by a repeti-
tion of their act, draw down upon themselves the burst of
indignant feeling with which the great bulk of the nation
will not fail to visit the disappointment of its hopes of
seeing an effectual check placed on the prosecution of this
infernal traffic." _ .

The Standard, in a leading article, the text of which is
fui nished by the Lords' erasure last night of some of the
clauses of the Metropolitan Police Improvement Bill, thus
attacks the Melbourne administration : --" The House of
Lords, thanks to the perseverance of Lord Lyndhurst and
Lord Brougham, atoned last evenin., for the error of
having sanctioned the second reading of' the Metropolitan
Police Improvement Bill, by striking out some of its most
objectionable clauses. Enough, however, remains to
render the Bill highly unconstitutional and mischievous.
By no Government that has ever presided over the affairs
of Great Britain, have the liberties of the people,
in the truest and most healthy signification of the
phrase, been less respected than by that of Lord
Melbourne. With all the common-places of liberality
continually in their mouths, they have contrived to
avoid exhibiting, by any single measure, the slightest
sympathy for the humbler classes of the community. On
the contrary, they have treated them uniformly as if worthy
only of the distinguished honour of being their slaves.
This total disregard of the feelings and necessities of the
lower orders, has been a marked feature of Lord Mel-
bourne's Government ; and would have proved more ob-
noxious than it has, but for the interposition of the House
of Lords."

MARKET INTELLIGENCE.

'From the London New Price Current of August 13.)

SUGAR'—The transactions in the British Plantation
Sugar market since this day week have been limited; the
demand from the grocers has been on a small scale for
brown as well as for yellow qualities ; the refiners have
bought sparingly, and such of the merchants as 'have been
inclined to realize, have been compelled to submit
to a reduction on previous rates of 6d per cwt ; the
purchases have amounted to 1,400 hhds and trees, including
170 casks Barbadoes at auction, which sold rather cheaper,
mid to good brought 65s to 67s 6d, 60 casks were damaged
and sold at 64s to 66s Gd for washed and shifted; 100
Barbadoes at auction, good and fine fetched 67s to 693,
and m d to good mid 65s to 66s Gd per cwt.
REFINED.—In the Refined market previous rates have
been supported. In goods made from Foreign Sugar there
has been less business done, and 34s 6d is the price of
Crushed, at which some small parcels have been sold.
Treacle has sold steadily, and former rates have been
maintained. 1,, Bastards and Pieces prices continue firm.
Dutch Crushed &gar is held for 33s 6d per c,vt.
Matormats.—The purchases by private contract have
bi en limited; and at the public sales of 10,993 bags,
former rates were not maintained by 6:1 per cwt, the whole,
r, found buyers, middling to fine brown at 60s to
62s Gd, low middling yellow 633 to 63s 6d, middlini 643
to 64s 6d, and good to fine 65s 6d to 67s per cwt.
EAST INDIA.—A steady demand has been experienced
for Bengal for home consumption, and full prices have
been paid; 4.030 bags at public sale were disposed of,
fine white at 68,4 to 695, good 67s Gd, middling to good
middling 65s to 663 Gd, damps 65s to 6Gs Gd, and washed
64s to 65s 6i. Manilla at auction 1,400 bags sold at 19s
to 19s Gd for ordinary soft brown, 21s 6d to 22s for low
middling yellow, and 178 6:1 to 21s 6d for damps and da-
maged. Sian: prices remain firm. Java is unaltered in
value : the demand, however, privately has been limited,
and none has been offered at public sale.
FORElGN.—Havannah of strong quality has again been
sought after, but the importers not being disposed to sell
at present rates, have prevented purchases of moment in
white, but of yellow 600 boxes have been sold affoat for
Antwerp at 275. Brown Brazil has been taken more
freely. 21s to 22s for fair Bahia. Of the present stock
of Havannah, 38,000 boxes, 13,000 boxes are white ; at
this time last year it was 17,200 boxes, and in 1837 only
6,857 bales.
This afternoon 27 chests and 303 brls Rio at auction
were all taken in at stiff prices, viz. mid to good soft brown
brls at 22s a 22s 6d, and one lot fine yellow in chests at
26s per cwt.
MOLASSES—In West India former rates have been main-
tained.
This afternoon 487 puns and 73 casks St. Vincent!, an
ordinary dark parcel, w, re submitted to public competition,
and all bought in at 33s 6d, but a part has since been sold
at that figure.
COFFEE—The small quantity of British Plantation
Coffee of clean quality at market has again checked
the demand; rather higher prices have been paid
by private contract for middling and good qualities.
This afternoon the auctions consisted of 19 casks 100 bags
British Plantation, and 15 bales Mocha; the former was
all unclean, and was taken in much above its value, viz.,
fine ord Berbice at 1105, and fine ord Demerara at 1003
per cwt ; the latter was a very inferior mixed second-hand
p ireel, and was bought in at 101 s per cwt. For Java 85s 6d
has been paid for good ordinary. West India, of clean
quality is wanted, but there is little to be met with. Fo-
reign is much enquired for, but there is little offering.

SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.

The Tory Journals seem almost at as great a loss
for materials to construct an opposition to the Mi-
nistry as the Israelites were in Egypt when attempting
to -make bricks without straw. Our opposition con-
temporaries have but three straws, or three subjects al-
together not worth, a straw, with which to build up the
battery that is to beat clown the Melbourne Adminis-
tvation. These are, the influence and dread of

O'Connell and the Papists—the dinners and drunken
revelries of the Tories—and that child of their own

adoption, if not begetting, the Poor Law Amendment
Act. The ingenuity with which these scanty ma-
terials are worked up is extraordinary, and if it were
nr,t for the surreptitious introduction of false weights
and measures, in the shape of enormous calumny
and indescribably indecent abuse, we should admire
the ability and perseverance with which the
factious prints ply their hopeless task. If we were
called upon to give proofs of the claims which
the Melbourne Cabinet has upon the country, we
should not place to much confidence in what it has
done or designed to do, as upon the dearth of inculpa-
tory evidence which its enemies, with all their reek--

lessicess of truth, can bring against it. On this alone
-would we confidently appeal to the sense of the coun-
try, feeling assured that the people of England would
not pronounce a verdict of guilty on the accusation of
Bedlamites, and knowing that all men of the least dis-
cernment must perceive that the idea of Popish ascend-
ancy can be entertained only by men who have lost
their reason. The miserable shifts to which the fac-
tion is reduced, may he jucle4ed by specimens given in
two articles in the Times of yesterday. In the first of
which is discussed the possibility of Popery being esta-
blished in Ireland, and the necessity of reconquering
that country deprecated in the following ludicrously af-
fected strain of humanity :—" Rather than relinquish,
every man in Britain will no doubt demand reconquer.
But, gracious Providence, are we to endure tine dominion
of these peddling slaves for the sake of entailing upon
ourselves the necessity of that reconquest which it
may cost the lives of half amillinn of deluded wretches
to complete ?" The Times appears exceedingly con-
siderate, and deserves credit for as much kind feeling
as those gentry who object to destroying game by
wholesale contrivance, in order that they may have
the pleasure of shooting them in detail. It woold be
an irreparable loss to the sport of the tithe agents to
have " half a -million of the deluded wretelies' taken
down in one fell swoop, when such constant and agree-
able recreation is afforded by having an occasional
field-day, such as that of Dunkerrin, 'Ratheormac, &c.
In the second article of the Times the new Poor Law
Bill furnishes the subject of grave accusation against
Ministers, and either through inexcusable ignorance, or
shameless malevolence, the writer attempts to get up a
charge against the Home Secretary on account of not
-having given a specific reply to a petition to his Ma-
jesty, praying for a repeal of the Poor Law Amend-
ment Aet. The reply to the petitioner stated that it
had been laid before his Majesty ; but this did not sa-
tisfy the concoctors of the petition= who appeared to
imagines that an answer shoul':l have come direct from
his Majesty himself, statir.g whether or not the law
should be repealed. It has ever been considered that
petitions addressed to his Majesty when received by
Ministers have reached their destination, as it
would be absurd to suppose that all petitions should
actually be presented to the supreme authority, as
his Majesty, if he had time to consider them, could
not, without trenching on the privilege of Ministers,
give any reply without their advice and acquiescence.
Yet, because Lord John Russell replied to a petition
in the usual manner, as practised by Pitt, Castlereagh,
Liverpool, Canning, and every other Minister for
years past, he is accused of " official impertinence."
The pitiable straits to which the Tories are reduced
cannot be more strongly illustrated than in the rom-
pous and important manner in which every con-
temptible creature who attaches himself to their cause is
introduced to public notice by their leading journals.
The filth collected by the scavenger who formerly
figured as secretary of the Catholic Association, fre-
quently fills two columns of the Times. Yesterday a
Mr. Postle, who, from the reverence which the Times
affects towards him, might be supposed an Apostle,
was represented as putting an extinguisher on the Re-
form of the House of Losds. Mr. Postle—be it
known to all men—as the Times informs us, said—
" he would never consent to abolish the House of
Lords." On this high authority the Times remarks,
" When English yeomen like Mr. Postle deliver such
sentiments, we would not give much for our House of
Lords Reformers." It is useless, in future, to inquire
into the state of public opinion—if we wish to ascer-
tain what is necessary or possible to be clone, we must
ask, " What does Mr. Postle say ?" Another recruit
whom the Times has picked up, is a Mr. Gough,
whose accusation against Ministers on the subject of
neglected petitions, furnished a text for the tirade to
which we have just referred. This gentleman's speech
figures at length in a leading article of the Times,
which seems suddenly affected with a deep sympathy
for the sufferings of the poor. The intent of this pre-
tended sympathy is too apparent to need exposure.
When the rights of the poor to politital freedom are
brought under consideration, those sufferina47, from
poverty are denounced as " a rebellious," " swinish
multitude," whom it would b',l madness to enfranchise
—but when the oppressor finds need of their sweet
voices, they are soother
with the softest words ima-
ginable—but whateve:.: their suffering, we would advise
them to endure arty thing, and hazard every thing,
rather than be &aped by their natural hereditary ene-
mies—the Toiles.—Morizing Advertiser.
A subject is at present before Europe which requires,
to elucid.ate its bearings, the reminiscences of history
for the last twenty-five years. We allude to the late
unexpected change in the relations between Sweden
and, Russia, which all hinge upon the feelings and
situation of the present King, Bernadotte. This wise
and politic Sovereign illustrates admirably the well-
known line of Voltaire—
" Le premier qui fut Roi, fut un soldat heureux."
Bernadotte, son of a peasant, born in Gascony, was at
the beginning of the Revolution a common trooper in
a regiment of cavalry. Possessing a mind of superior
powers, in the convulsions of the revolutionary times,
and in the military reign of Buonaparte, he found his
level, and gradually lose to the rank of 2narsechal ; in
which capacity, commanding that division of the French
army whose field of operation bordered on Sweden, he
first became connected witia that country. When the un-
fortunate Gustavus, the last King of the House of Vasa,
probably sinking ue.:ter the mental anxiety which his chi-
valric resistance to the overwhelming power of Buona-
parte occasioned, became mad, the old Duke of Suder-
mania, master of the Throne of his exiled relative, turned
towards Bernadotte for counsel and support, and ul.
timately adopted him. At his death Bernadotte, who
had inspired the Swedes with deep admiration for his
political wisdom, military talents, and personal feelings,
was raised by them to the throne. His accession met
with the approbation of the Holy Alliance, which, not-
withstanding its good will towards the rightful heir,
owed a debt of gratitude to Bernadotte for his very ef-
fective aid against Buonaparte at a time when, although
somewhat reduced, his power was still so colossal as
overshadow the whole of Germany. Bernadotte
natu::-.
being raised to the Throne of Sweden, es-
poused the inveterate hatred of the S
the Russians, who had conquered ..vedes towards
firm them, in 1808,
their most splendid proviri.,,e,
the -: Finland. Bernadotte
more readily jo;
ded in this hatred as he feared
Russia would :nake his doubtful title to the Throne a
lever to overthrow him, and in the confusion push
'more forward the boundary of her power, which, like
the ocean, always encroaches, but, unlike it, never re-
tires. That the Emperor Alexander should do this
was the more to be expected, as he was related by
marriage to the sou of the exiled Gustavus, now a
Lieutenant-General in the service of Austria. Until
within the last year or two the hatred of Bernadotte
Brit' the Swedes towards the Russians continued un-
?abated, and at the time when the Poles appeared likely
to throw off their sway, the sympathy of the nation
was expressed in terms which set all diplomatic oh-
Bervances at defiance. Suddenly, however, peculiar
symptoms of change in Bernadotte 's conduct appeared.
The first was a misunderstanding with the King of the
Barricades, then greatly out of favour with the Northern
Autocrat, which was followed by the most friendly
demonstrations towards Russia. Of late the ties of

friendship have been drawn still closer, and the change
of sentiments has now reached a climax for which the
world, in its astonishment, has naturally sought a solu-
tion. That there is some motive of deep import
existing nobody can doubt, for otherwise Bernadotte,
already at war with the Storthing, which has impeached
a Minister, whose dismissal or resignation he Will not
allow of—Bernadotte, we say, would hot oppose the
general feelings of the country iegattling Russia. The
explanation given is, that Bernadotte, approaching
the termination of hi 4 hfe, is seeking protection for his
son Oscar, who Las no claims beyond the respect
due to his father's memory—his own merits, such
as thri are—and his dubious connection with
the powerless King of Bavaria, through a daugh=
ter of Eugene Beauharnais. These are the only
points of support of Oscar against the caprices
of a free nation so renowned fort owning, exiling, and
assassinating their sovereigns, There are three par-
ties in Sweden—one for Prince Oscar's succession—a
second looking to the example of Bernadotte's own
ascent to the tt.irone, in favour of his successor being
elected-0:x third desirous of bringing back the sue-
cessior. in the legitimate line. To secure the latter
ob,j'ect, of course Gustavus and his son have at this
opportune moment exerted their utmost power ; and in
pursuance of it they have invoked the principles of
legitimacy pervading the great Cabinets of the North,
particularly that of Austria, which, in the case of the
succession of the present exiled Duke of Brunswick,
has lately exhibited a strong feeling.—Morning Post.

POLICE INTELLIGENCE.

MANSION-HOUSE.

A. gentleman of the name of Drew, of Great Trinity- I I
lane, Bread-street, applied to the LORD MAYOR yeStPl`day
upon the subject of a vessel which was wrecked. in Torres
Straits some time ago, and the passengers ar..;:i crew of which
were supposed to have been taken by the savage natives,
and detained in slavery. He had Ileen on intimate terms
of friendship with some of the unfortunate passengers,
whose relatives and fric7ids were in the most dreadful sus-
pense as to their fate, and was acquainted with Mr. Bailey,
who not long n'-go applied to the Secretary of State, in-
forming him. that the Captain of the Augustus Casar was
likely to be able to make some communication respecting
those who had been wrecked. His object was to request
the Lord Mayor to apply to Messrs. Buckle, of Mark-
lane, the owners of the ship Mandes, which had lately
arrived in the port of London, and had (he understood)
anchored for some time at Merrily's-Island, in Torres Straits,
to give directions to the Captain and crew to afford all the
information they possessed on the subject. He had reason
to suppose that more was known than had been stated.
The LORD MAYOR knew Messrs. Buckle, of Mark-lane,
to be persons of the first respectability, and wholly incapable
of conceal;.ng any information which it might be proper for
the frie:ids of the passengers and crew to receive ; and he
was also convinced that a gentleman of the character which
Captain Carr, the commander of the vessel, bore, would not
hesitate to give to all interested the most full answers to
their inquiries.
Mr. Drew stated that one of the crew, he was given to
understand, had mentioned that he saw a white man at
Torres Straits, who intimated that several of those who had
been wrecked were up the country, detained by the natives.
The two mates of the Mangles gave accounts which varied
considerably, and to relieve the anxioty of the friends of
the unfortunate people who were missing, it was to be hoped
that the Lord Mayor, who had so warmly interested him-
self before, on the application made by Lord Glenclg for
the examination of the captain and crew of the Augustus
Ccesar, would cause investigation to be made into the cir-
cumstances supposed to be known to the crew of the
Mangles. He (Mr. Drew) was convinced that if his
Lordship did not interfere, the details of the informati.on
would not be made known by the captain,whom he, liad seen
yesterday, and who certainly gave a most meagre account of
the circumstances. Mr. Bayley intended to have waited
upon his Lordship, but he was tumble ; and it was that
gentleman's intention, if the Lord Mayor was not able to
cause the investigation to be undertaken, to apply to the
Secretary. _ _

The LORD IV{on said the applicant might write to
them in his (t ue Lord Mayor's) name, and no doubt a
satisfactorj answer, as far as they and the captain and
crew of the Mangles were concerned, would be given im-
med;.ately.
Mr. Drew should make the application as suggested by
the Lord Mayor, and inform his Lordship of the result.
A. young man named John Roberts was brought up,
charged with having, in conjunction with others, plundered
the Green Dragon public-house, in Sun-street, Bishopsgate,
of a quantity of bedclothes and wearing apparel.
The prisoner said that he had been singing in the tap-
room with two or three others, but he knew nothing of the
robbery. Upon his person was found a duplicate, which,
it appeared, he had stolen from a foolish person who had
been treating him, and those who are believed to have been
his accomplices in the robbery.
He was remanded for further examination.
The landlord had objected to the conduct of the party a
short time before, and told them that they should not any
more enter his doors.

She protested that the statement of her husband •••as to-
tally void of truth.
Mr. LAING, after considering some time, stated that
even if the charge were true, the husband was art accessory
to the mutclerl and under etl the circumstances he should
noteritektgh it,
husband—Do you let her go ? Mr. LAING—Yes, if
you can obtain further evidence, I will listen to the accusa-
tion again, but not without%
The parties then quitted the die&

THAMES OFFICE.
estehlas StAdn-, a hey, abed thirtten years,
a native of Scotland., Wo betitSilit kefore Mr. BALLANTINE,
charged Witl) 'ities6li4 lilmer Claringbould, a boy aged eight
yeart Trott! hover. Mr. Banks, the steward of the Har-
16fttih steamer, belonging to the General Steam Navigation
Company, stated that Dover had been in a state of rCnt
consternation in consequence of the sudden abtiente of a
boy, the son of a lady residing there, and Whose father
was living in France. The circumstance of the boyss dis-
appearance had reached him at ,
Bottiogfie akid ar-
rival of the Itarlegetin ht the tiVOt P??, "oaturday afternoon,
he was informed thAta 'boy answering his description
had been ittn at one of the wharfs near London Bridge,
and had been sleepit', on the quay. He made in-
quiries, and found the boy at the house of Mr. Scott, a
respectable lighterman, residing in Mill-lane, Tooley-street,
who Lad kindly sheltered him. He was the same boy
Who had been missing from Dover. On making further

inquiries he ascertained that the prisoner, who was a
sailor boy, had formerly belonged to the Arab, a schooner
trading between London and Perth, had been discharged
by the captain for some reason, and had formed a resolu-
tion in his own mind to travel to London to get another
ship but being without the means of doing so, he prevailed
on young Claringbould, whom he met on his way to school

in Dover. High-street, on Wednesday morning, to ac-
sonapany him to the metropolis, and induced him in th
first instance to go to his grandmother, living the town,
and procure a quantity of victuals. This having been effected
they set off to Canterbury, where they slept in a cart in
the cathedral dose, and at three o'clock on Thnttchty Molt-
ing they started for Rochester. Their steels o 1 provisions
being expended, Claringbould sent out by his compa-
nion to solicit money and rod, and he got a supply of bread.
They wandered at ont Rochester during the whole of Thurs-
day night), MIA were frequently challenged by the town-
writeh, On Friday morning Stalkan ordered the child to
Solicit more vistuals, but he met with bad success, at some
places the parties giving him a dry crust, and others telling
him they had none for themselves, On Friday morning they
left Rochester for London, Which they managed to reach
before dark. They took up their abode for the night On
Carpenter Smith's Wharf, Tooley-street, On the fellfting
morning the prisoner left Claringbould in a 'boat miserable
condition of cold and hunger, and phiceeded in search of a
morsel. Mr. Scott, the lighterman, who had business at
the wharf, observed the destitute state of the boy Claring-
bould, and took him to his own house, where he gave him
some refreshment. In the course of the day the prisoner
returned, and hearing that Claringbould was at Mr. Scott's
house, went there, and persuaded him to leave. After
giving him three biscuits, he put him on his way to Dover,
to which place he told him to make the best of his way.
Their motions were, however, observed by Mr. Scott's son,
who went after the child and brought him back. He was
taken care of until witness arrived, when he took him on
board the Harlequin. The boy was so ill that he could re-
tain nothing on his stomach, but owing to proper treatment
he was now in a fair way of recovery.
John Gaskin, a Thames Police surveyor, was called on
board the Harlequin by Mr. Banks, who stated that Stalkan
had enticed the child away. He understood that Stalkan,
who was the son of respectable parents in Scotland, had
been dismissed from the Arab, at Dover, for dishonesty,
and had worked on the fears of the child to accompany
him to London.
The chila Claringbould, a little simple fellow, on being
qur_.:stioned by Mr. BALLANTINE, said that Stalkan told
him that his mother was waiting for him at London Bridge,
and assured him that all the streets there were paved with
silver and gold. He also stated that if his mother was not
waiting for him at London Bridge, he would take him to
Scotland, send him to school there, and make a captain of
him. He was likewise to say if any questions were put to
him by the people on the road that he was on his way to
see his grandmother, and that Stalkan was his guide.
Mr. BALLANTINE said the villain who decoyed the child
away deserved a good flogging. The case was not one,
however, of which he could take cognizance, and he thought
the best way of disposing of the case was to send the child
on board the Harlequin, where he had been treated so
humanely by Mr. Banks, and to take the prisoner on board
the Rose, where he would be conveyed to Perth.
Stalkan was then removed in custody.

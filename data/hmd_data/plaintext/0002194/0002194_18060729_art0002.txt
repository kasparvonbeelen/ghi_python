7.xtria ofd Letter from Capt. Krtsensterri.to M. Schubert,
'of the Royal Academy at St: PetersburAh.
• " Port St. Peter and t. Pahl, jade 5, 1835..
.‘.O Our voyage to Japan ha§ been happily aeconl-
plished, atid• two days ago I came to an anchor here.
We sailed froth Kamschvka on the 7th of Septetn-
: ber, 1804, and as the se•kn was so -far advanced. I
made it iny- main objetdr. .convey the Ambassador
as speedily as. possible. to .r...Tinigasacki. During this
Voyage, however, I Visited-the :quarter where two
clusters of Islands are marked upon some ,charts,
'under the names Of " The Islands. of 1..664. and
1714." : I:keps.elose to that .direetione but-'.saw-no
land. •At last, hoWever, we descried the Coast of
Japan: A violent s.torin at:first drove us to sea
again.. • .When it abated we stood in for-the land
second time, but found ourselves just as we neared
the Coast involved in the.greatet danger by the un-
expated appearance of a .4yphon., A sudden change
of wind could alone have saved Us, and such a
-change did occur as .it •were by. rnil'acle: _ three
hours more we should, have- been destroyed. • This
tempest Was succeeded by fine wpatlwr,. 'and I had
an opportunity of examining the South-east, CoaSt
of Japan: I sailed through. Van Die-man's Straits..
This passage is Jaid •down in a very Afferent man-
ner On the-French .and the English charts; but,, in
this respect, I found both the French and the Eng-
lish wrong. We have, however, traced this part of
the Japanese Coast with an accuraty which leaves
nothing further to,be Swished: We have measured
more, than one thousand angles.. ‘Ve.discovercd
• five Islands in thei Straits,. and you may easily ima-
gine how very defeClive all the charts oflhis -part of
Japan are. We -have besides diStlovered several
other Islands and: dangerous ridges: rocks, the
positions of •which we 'have corre&ly ascertained.
We have also accurately Marked die latitude and
longitude bf the Gettoro Islands, which are situated
to, the South-west Cape of Gottoro, which fern's the
South-west :point of the Japanese domin,ions; they
are laid down with equal preciSioh: On the Bth of
Oc.rttH ber we cast anchor at Nangasacki, where' we
lay until the 18th .of During these
seven months I enjoyed corupetetranvillity, and I
did not spend the time uselessly.,
• ylt is now my duty to gi%'e.-you'abritf account of
the manner in Whickl was employed. - In concert
with Dr. H9ll'kER, I first endeavoured to ascerta=in
the longitude of Nangasacki by. the Moon's distance.
Each-6f us me:ism-cc' more than 'five hundred dis-
tances. The medium of all our observations- gave
Us for the longitude 230.- 8. west from Greenwich,
for the :•latitude 32. 44.-6,0. Thus thiS city,
though known for these S'ilars., las; for the-first
time, had; its position -properly. ascertained• by us.
In, the COII72OISVINCe des and on almost all
charts, the longitudit- is 228 Ib, and
.tlie. latitude
32. 32. •The patch never published any 'thing on
latitudeeand -,longitude of Nangasacki, -• The
months of Oapber, November,
,and December were
-delightful.,, , The weather was mild and unrufliedbr
any storm. •The Winter coin iienced with 'January ;
the :,,vind was then sometimes.violent,and.the
,-,morilz?.ter fell to the freezing point, bait there ewas
very little snow. I have made a variety of O4ser-

SOLEM QUIS DICERE FALSUM AVDEAT?

LONDOI

TUESDAY, JULY e 9; 1806.

Allaniburgh Mail arrived •this. .morning. The
following are the principal articles of intelligence

wllich it brings :

VIENNA, JULY 12.—N0 accounts have yet bee,ll,
received of, the surrender of Cataro : all that ha§-
ipeen repor'te-d.on that subje& is. premature.
Our CcAut'Gazette,.ofthis day, contains the fol-
lowing intelligence, under the head Turkiw
IJostilities between the Turks and the Servian
Incurgentc, on
.the Drina, still continue. The en-1
gli,-,:rnent in a wood near•Ustriza, in.which thefor-
tner endeavoured to seize the cattle of the. Servians,
,enied > ntirely to the disadvantage. of the Turks,
who left some .hundreds killed and wounded on the
place.

" The Servians within these few dap have like.
wise obtained artillery, which will be ernploYed in
besieging Belgrade in form, :where the bitterest
enemy of the Servians,.since the murder Of the Deys,
KITSCITANZY Am, continues_ his viOlence, and con-
fines as a prisoner the,Governor,- SIJLEYMAN 'PASHA,
whOrl he will not suffer to confer on -business with

any one except in his presence. The ganison con-
sists only of about 2000 Turks capable of bearing
arms, and abdut 600 Albanese or Arnauts. hey
are in-no want of provisions, Which-are supplied for
the most part freorn Semlin.
" On the 15th of May thekVortress of Selt,,ahatz
surmudered to the Servians, wig? four•bo-
dies, near Pascharsvacz, and on the. main road to
Constantinople, near Esupria and Jazodin; watch
the motions of the Turkish Armies near Nissa and
Adrianople. KUSCI:IAN,ZY- ALI will, now immediately
he removed from Belgrade, and succeeded by the
G.)vernor of New Orsowa. The mere report of this
change has caused the greatest joy among the Ser-

Vlans.

." The last Caravan to the holy 'city of Mecca,
which was escortedlby the Bashaof Tripoly, Di SoIRA,
was attacked in the Desert by a numerous Troop- of
Wechabites, when, after a desperate contest, the
greater part of the Caravan was murdered, and,
those who escaped the sword were carried into
slavery."

RATISBON, JULY 11.—Thp Envoy for the; Arch-
dtichy of Austria. Baron FAEINENBERG, has given in
' a Rescript to, the Diet relative to theeleEtion Of the
Coadjutor to the Arch-Chancellor, in which HiS
Imperial Majesty signifies, that this event was to
hire most unexpected and extraordinary ; and tho'
the Elector Arch-Chancellor of the Empire lire-
,supposed the' Imperial consent as certain, His Ma-
jesty was bound., by the Capitularies of elecaion, to
maintain, inviolate the rights Of the Chapter of
j2Mentz, on which account he could not immediately
'and absolutely decide, but must maturely consider
all the circumstances of the affair according to-his
duty and office as Head of the 'Empire.'
JTILY 14.—The Chevalier VARTCOURT, who
ar-
rived be.re from :Paris on.the 9th, brings advice that
the fate of the German- Empire -has be.en.deter-.
niined by the French Emperor,:and that the Decla-
ration on the subject has been-expedited. , We
therefore hourly expeCt the Courier who will bring
the communication, which WriS already prepared at-
Me departure of M. Ds VARICOURT.
According to what is understood of the new or
iler of things, it will be very different, from the for.-
Among the new Electors, the Prince of Ho
ITENZOLLERN SIGMARINGEN is named, who will
Marry a Princess of the Imperial House.
Many diplomatic persons now doubt the speedy
departure. of the French army,' as the change made
at Ragusa will have a great infilience on the resolu7
tioris taken elt St. Petersburgh.
- BANKS OF'TEF; MAINE, JULY 1,5:=-"ACCOriliilg to
accounts contained in sevepl private letters,- the
Courts of Munich, Studgardt, and Carlsrube,
soon deliver. into the Diet at Ratisbon a very im-
portant Common Declaration relative to their future
connexion and relations with the German Empire,
ROME, JUNE -25.—The Military Garrisons in the
-neighbourhood of Rome increase from' day to day.
At Civita Vecchia, the French exercise not only the
'Military but the Civil power likewise. The Polish
Corps, the TfanOverian Legion, and the newly-
formed Regitnenta of Lateiur D'Auvergne, ,are dis-
t ibuted around Rome.. 'There is ne Garrison in the
City, but troopS on their way through it are conti-
nually there. General.DumEN lately caused a per-
son be arrested, on suspiciotA Of heing,a Sicilian
sPY •

rner.

The situation. of Gaeta • is still the mile. The
Prince of HEssE FiIILIPSTITAL keeps up an unintFri
rtip.:-OFindsterrible fire on the works of the besiegers;
who cau curry them 'op but vety. owly, and by

their own account will not be. able to attempt any
thing against the Fortress before, the 'end of July.
Last week it was remarked that Negotiations were
cariying on with the Government of Naples, but
the subjc(:.;i of them is unknOwni On Mondayand
, -
Tuesdayno firs was niade from the fortress ; but
since then it has been renewed and.kept up without
interruption.-
Ti b French assert that in July they will storm
tbitortress with 30,000 men, and they will then
Vtcoably. take ii.;.,bdt it will cost them a great
'eq'itt.4hter of their Troops. Whether they will aCtually
tatie this sacrifice, in order to,obtain possession of
a fortress which' can be of little use Co them (asit
I'olll always be in the power of the English to lay it.
iti .ruins from the sea-side in half an hour), time
it shew.

NAPLES, JUNE 25.—The property of the fami-.
lies who have followed the old. Court to Naples has
been sequestered, and notice given to the proprietors
-to return to Naples by a certain time on pain of
confiscation of that property..
The repOrt is generil, throughout Lower Italy,
that there «•ill be great changes in, the Pontifical
Mate.

f 3 rziv; JULY lg.—The Minister for Meekien-
hurg-h, at our Court, has frequent conference's with
Count HAUGI.VITZ, rClatiVC to the d!,fferences which
subsist between our Cabinet and that of Stockholm. -
The ekehange of Couriers between Berlin, St. Pe-
,
tersburgh; and Griefswald is very aaive.

Th 6. day before ,yesterday the. Cabinet Minister,
Count HA VGW T Z;\ Ara with his Majesty at Char-
.
lottenburgh. Yesterday, he. accompanied Count
STACKELBEIIp thither, who delivered to his Majesty
'a Letter,from• the Emperor ALEXANDER. ,

ANOTHER L'ETTEZ SAME DATE.

The- day: before yesterday a Russian Courier ar-
rived lere from St. lietersburgh. , He bad made the
journey, in a Very,Short, time,- viz. eight days. i The
.Dispatches he brings relate to the differences between
our Court and Sweden. - •

Count STACItiELBERG had yesterday morning an
audience of the King,. and afterwards was gracious-
ly invited by his
.Majesty to'dine,with,him.

- • THE Expeditions which - are fitting out from
Ports Month and RaMsgate will sail almost imme-'
diately: The latter, it is known, is destined for
Sicily. With respeEt to the destination of the for-
mer, we have some reason, to believe that its obje&
is to support the Expedition lately undertaken by-Sir
HOME POPHAM bgai tisf Buenos Ayres. That .ex-
pedition; as far as we can learn, was the result of his.
own enterprizing charaaer, and not the consequence
of orders from this Country., The
_.tnesure, how-
ever, is very promising, and its success would, be
highly important to this Country; and therefore
Government, we presume; think it proper to send
. ,
a powerful reinforcement. • •

Reports have been circulated of a serious conflia
having taken place hi Ireland, between , a body of
the Getman Troops and
.sorne.of the Militia in Ire-
land. We are not able positively to contradict the
fad, but. we have received petters and Papers from
Dublin this 'morning •which ,do not state any such
event to -Wye takn. place. •

According to, the accounts 'of private., letters,
brought by -the List. Shirs..likan India, the recent
Treaties between our Government and Sciikini'A
and HOLicAR have not ,operated much .upon the
honour, justice, and `gratitude of those
Sci A; it is
.said, has condiVEted himself with such
evident hostility since he
.wa,s put in possession of
the Fort Of Golaud, that the j3ritish Forces were ors
dered to coinnience an assault against it six weeks
after it -wasceded to him by Treaty.. We •do not.
,
place implicit confidence in these: reports, partici'-
,
lady as other letters, of at least eqnal authority, re-
present India,as, at the same time, being in the -ut-
most state of peace and tranquillity. • • •

- Mr. Fox was .able to fake more exercise yester-,
day than for some days past, but we do not hear
that there is any essential.change• for the, better in
the general condition of his health. .
'His MAJESTY is eXpeaed in town to-morrow, to
hold a Privy, Council.
Yesterday morning His MAJESTY, DUKE of CUM-
BERLAND, PRINCESSES AUGUSTA and AMELIA, rode
in Windsor Great Park, attended byGeneral CART-
WRIGHT and Colonel TAYLOR, and the CountesS
of ELY, in a phaeton. •
Yesterday the Royal Stafford Regiment- was re 7
viewed by the DUKES of YORK and CAMBRIDGE; Ge-
nerals FITZROY and HARCOURT attended them ; Co-
lonel DEsnsow-commanded. The DUKES thanked
the Officers- for their attention to the Regiment.
After the Review the DUKES went into Windsor
Great Park, aDajOiDed THEIR MAJESTIES, 'and re-
turned to the Castle at one o'clock.
The RQYAL DUKES dined with'the Officers of the
Stafford' Regiment at the Barracks:

at Guildhall yesterday, to receive the answer of JoIIN

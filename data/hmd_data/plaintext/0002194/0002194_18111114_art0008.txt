FROM
BUENOS AYRES GAZETTES to SErT. 12.

DECkEE GF TUE PROVISIONAL JUNTA OF TUE UNIT-
ED :ROVINGES OF THE RIVER PLATA, IN THE
NANO OF.FERDINAND VII.
The existing Government, since the, first mo-
ment of its installation, has beheld with the greatest
regret, the mkerahle and debased condition of the
race of Indians. These our brothers, who are cer-
tainly the first-born sons of America, were excluded
from the blessing and advantages of their native soil ;
and, niade the victims of ambition, they were not
'only buried M the most..ignottunions -slavery, but
ohutlemned to glut,the avarice and luxury ot their
oppressore.,
A. fate sc) humiliating could not fail to interest the
sensibility of a Government which endeavoured to
promote the general h;ppieiesy of the country—not.
by insignificant prociamatious and mere words, but
by Harrying into.elfeki the satne liberal p\-iticip!es
to
%ilia 'it 'tweed its formation,. and which must pro-
duce its continnauce and telicity.
All the members of the Government, deeply in).-
pressed with these/principles, and desirous at adopt=
ing all the means calculated to restore,the Indiarts
to
their prinittivu right.:, declared forthwith their pos-
session of equal rights h the other Classes which
compose the State ; incotporated their corps with
those,'of the Spanish Americans which were raised
in this capital; ordered that the same should be
dons in all theotherprovinces buited to our system;
and diet they should be considered as capable at
rising, to alt, the, ranks, .offices, and posts, which
have been the birth-tight ot Spaniards; us any other
class at inhabitants ; and that their instrud ion, corn-
coerce, and freedom, should be promoted to evety
possible way, in order to annihilate in them those
gloomy ideas which tyranny had caused them to in-
dulge. ,They were even invited, to a share in the
' Supreme Governmeot of the inktien, ,
It only rimaitiedio destroy the last , link of the
chain of servitude, by the abolition ,of ,rthe tribute.
This was paid to the Crosti of Spin as a mark of
conquest ; atni they were thus compelled to, recog-
onto as a benefit, the ,irritating act which had de-
prived them ot their liberty. ,
The Juntif had,long resolved to put a period .to
this ignominious badge.of, servitude ; but the pro-
Visioual nature of their trace had hitherto induced
them ,to 'reserve, that measure for the Gene al Con=
vest. Now, however, when the majority ofohe
Deptities horn the provitices ale a,seinbled,. and
when. also a variety of iinpetious circoinstances
continue to ;delay the opening of that august tis•
sembly; it does not appear expediwt any,longer to
suspend a resolution; whirl:, (!onneeli,ei v,vith
many others, Must bee •me, the eitie'l ba,is of tier
regeneration. From these coosiderations, the Junto
have resolved
Ist. Thor henceforward, in all time coming, the
tribute which the Indians paid to t fie Crown of
Spain shall be abolished in the distrids o
of the
f-the
provinc-s tqtedAn the existing government
river Plata.
: That in ord.!r to give all due effea to the pre-
sent resolotioo, it shall ne published in all the chief
towns and. villages of the provinces of the, interior ;
and that all .exaction of the said tribute y shall betice-
purposeb th e shall cause
forwardeafie. For which
a sultidentinumber ot copies to. be printed in Spa-
Did) and Wichua, to be sent to the provincito
al
Jatna,G and other ...‘lagistratets, v6o shall etiend

BUENOS AYIII4, SEPT. !0,--The junta have pub-
fished a list of those ficers who lied at the coin-
ma.c,mait of the ittotOfion with Goyoneche, on the
Desaguadeco, the ptillmse of holding them tip
to contempt and detestation. They have also puts-
in their Gizette, aim Go) oneche abandoned,
on. the 2(1 .of August tlu posit ion which he, had
taken up, with the valiguaidof his army in the town
ot Oruro, in consequence of the total NiFant of pro
jSIOU4, and the hostilities which he had experieneal
from the inhabitants of COehabamba. A party of
the latter ate said to have
Cate ked tache treoops whiT ch
atiardtd his mules, atILI atten tooo of ilint .he.

greater part of the Awn; of Oruro is said tto have
been destroyed.
The Junta have published General Order', dated
September 6, from which the Itallowitig are ex-

traels
" NlTe:•tatinot dissemble it—oar situation is dan-
gerous. ' Since the defeat of our troops an the l)e-
-saguadero, the execrable patricide Goyoneehe has
occupied la Paz ; and is endeavouring again to, sub-
jeCt the people, despoiled of their rights, to the yoke
of their oppressors. Infamous Minister of arbitrary
pewer, he is not ashamed to • have recourse to vio,
letice, in order to establish despotism on the ruins of
his,cpuntry. The Authorities at Monte Video, on
the Other hand, derive encouragement from the
proxiMity of the Portuguese -troops; whom thty
haveltiVited to: their assistance, and are disposed to
barter their liberty for vengeance. What laurels
will they gain by so aeting ? Let them fear lest they
fall into the same abyss which they are endeavour-
ing to open for. us, should they tel to enter into
e beneficial reconciliation.
The country., then, is ie danger ; and still it' is'
savage war must be the principal ohjeet to which the
Attention of Government is directed. The warlike
virtues shall be the road to distinction, hotnear, and
dignity. The troops shall be under the Most severe
discipline; their only relaxation shall be,in a change
of military occupation. All the citizens ate born
soldiers, and shall receive from their infancy an e!ta-
cation. conformable to their thistimstion. ;The field
of Mars shall be the public school where the young
tnen shall gri through their; apprenticesoip, pro•
cure fur themselves robust constiturlow. The
cities shall present only the image of war: In tine, .
ever) citizen shall look upon hig arms ofi
a .part of himself, and war as his natural state.
¶,ce"lt• is necessary to convince (;oyourche, that
turbulent and aulacious man, that bar defeat
hag' only served to try our constancy ; to convince
Elio and those of Monte Video, that our lives shall
be- fatal to them and their auxiliaries ; und, in
shore, every enemy of our liberty, that the swprd in
our hands is not an. useless, weapon ;, and that. hay-
ing once drawn it„, we have thrown away the scab
bard for, ever.
" The Junta have therefore adapted the, follow-
ing resolutions :
" tst. A Committee of War shall be appointed,
which shall inspect the arming and equipment of
the troops, carry into etfeot, plans fol. the improves 7
went of the organization •:•of .the troops, ()Vibe aye...
tern of supplies, the order of march, cantonments,
and every thing connected with naive service.
" 2d. The Cadets shall daily attend the military
academy, in order to be instrueted as speedily as
possible in .tlie rudiments of the theory of war.
3d. That every day the corms u 1 troops shall
be drilled and manaluvred ;' and their arms, accou•
trements, and uniforms inspected.
4th. That military diseiplute, the only means
of the preser;,ation of an army, be obsened with
the 'greatest severity.
" ,501. That the Military Commli`Sion take came
that the most speedy dispatch be given to trials by
Courts-martial, and the sentences' be carried into
effect withbut the least delay. ,
" 6th, As, in order to triumph in this formidable
contest, it is necessary that every one should be de-
voted to war, and that even boys should acquire a
taste for.arms, an'abitract at the military regulations
shall' be pated and distributed in the schools', Thai
the boys may be fcimiliarized• with thein, and that
invalid serjeants be emploida in teaching theta
the manual exercise. For this purpose they are to
be assembled every Thursday, in a certain spot, in
order that, the idea May' be deeply engraved on
their tender minds, that they are the hopes.of their
country and that to serve it, to tlefenclAts rights..
and to ameliorate the fate of their posterity, their
constant motto Must be, " Honour and DiAci3Oline."

SY THU HON. WILLIAM. ROBERT SPENCER.

WHT ra first o'er Ps Yell E's angel breast
Love's yet tintruant pinions played,
Of either parents, charms possest,
My birth their mutual flame betray'd.
No limbs my airy charms o4Fure,
No bone my elfin forrh'eu.taitis ;
Yet blood i boast, as warm, as pure,
As that which throbs in Hines veins.

• I sleeßwith.beauty, watch with le4r,
I rise in modest youth's defence,
And swift appear, it' danger's near
The now-drop path of Innouenee.

Sometimes'in ciyt PO Hall I'm sem,
But soon those sterner duties fly,
On ti,,w'ry hank. or vil6ge green,
tly parents', gentler cause tb try.
Lo've'ssun'-shine, beint'd from brightest eyes,
Less cheers his vot'ry's: painful duty, p
Thin my -auspicious light, which flies.
Like meteors o'er the heav'n of beauty,.

'Yesterday morning, about four o'clock, a fire
broke out in the sontb.aist angle of the Parliament
flonse,,in the new buildings adjoining the Court, of
Exchequer.' ,At one time the appearance of the
flames was very alarn'ing ; but as there was loanoafety,,iit,tle wind;' towards six they begin gradually
to abate, and before seven they were so tar got under
fig to cause very little alum.
The Lord Provost ond Msgistrate, the Judge of
Police, the military, the firemen of the different Of.
flees, with their-engines, and the police -men, attend- .
ed on the first alarm. Of, no occasion was greater
dildayed--indeed, on no ia,:casion do we
recollect a fife, the piogress of which might have
proved more ruinous, twin the i aluable building
in the immecti no vicinity, had it nut been so
promptly got under.
The Court itself is wholly uninjured, and of:the
few papers.that May have been. destroyed, duplicatts
are preserved in other places.. „ •

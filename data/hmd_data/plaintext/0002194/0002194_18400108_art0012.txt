PALMERSTON has acquiesced in the proposal made
to the Representatives of the Great Powers on the
Eastern question by M. BRUNOW, the Russian
Envoy Extraordinary. That proposal is to the
following effect :—That in the event of 'ME-
HEMET Am's army advancing upon Constantino-
ple, Russia shall be allowed to march a certain
number of troops to defend the capital, and that the
fleets of France and England shall enter the Darda-
nelles, but only in force and numbers, respectively,
proportionate to the military strength employed by
Russia. Our Contemporary maintains that by
such a stipulation England recognizes the treaty
Of UNKIAR SKELESSI. This is not the fact.
Such an agreement has reference merely to a future
and barely possible contingency. It recognizes no
treaty whatever. By proposing it Russia admits
that were the whole naval power of England and
France to appear in the Sea of Marrnora, the
question would be at once settled without her inter-
ference. 'v'4 hat she stipulates for is not the recog-
nition of a treaty, but a claim to a co-ordinate right
of. interference !with the great Western Powers.
That she will deceive us if she can we well
know, but let us not aid her by the misrepresenta-
tion of facts, with the factious view of damaging an
Administration. The British Government has
officially refused to recognize the Treaty of UN-
KIAR SKELESSI, and whatever stipulation it may
now enter into with Russia on the question of a
joint protective force to maintain the integrity'of the
Ottoman Empire, we have no hesitation in affirm-
ing, that were such a measure necessary to the.
maintenance of the national honour and the safety
of the Porte, the same British Government would
soon convince Europe that that treaty was not
worth the parchment upon which it was written.

The debate on the Address, in answer to the
Speech from the Throne commenced in the French
• chamber of Peers on Monday. The principal
orators were M. CHARLES DUPIN, who spoke
against the Address and the Ministry; M. DAL-
TON SHEE, who attacked the Ministry only ; M.
DUFAURE, Minister of Public Works, who de-
fended himself and his colleagues ; and M. MoLE,
who spoke in favour of the Ministry of the 15th of
April. M. CHARLES DUPIN reversed the argu-
ments of the British Tories as regards France, repre-
senting her as miserable at home, and contemptible
abroad, while, on the contrary, England was pros-
perous and respected in every part of the world.
There was nothing novel in the arguments on either
side, and after a good deal of talk the two first para-
graphs of the address were voted without a division.
The Colonial Council of Martinique has voted
the emancipation of the slaves in that colony to be
impossible, without exposing the slave-owners to
be massacred, and securing the return of the slaves
to a state of barbarism. What an appalling com-
mentary is this upon the horrors of slavery I
The latest Lews from Africa is of the 28th ult.
The colonists in the plains were continually ha-
rassed by the Arabs, who carried off their cattle,
and hindered their defensive works. Several skir-
mishes had taken place, in which casual losseswere
sustained on both &: dies. On the 26th, a French
merchant vessel, the Frederic Adolphe, while
teen miles from the shore, had been attacked and
captured by an armed vessel from Cherchell, a point
nearly half way between Algiers and Oran. The
pliynx and Crocodile steamers, with a detach
went of the 23d of the Line, went to Cherchell, and
found the vessel ashore. She was therefore burnt.
The Arabs resisted the burning of the vessel, and
the French had four killed and 13 wounded.

ABD-EL-KADER had received a deputation
from the Sultan of Monocco, who recognised
him as Grand Khaliff of Algiers. An attack on
Oran was hourly expected.

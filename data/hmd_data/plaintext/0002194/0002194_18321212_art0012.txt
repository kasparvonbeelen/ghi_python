MALD ON.-(RECEIVED THIS DAY )

(TUESDAY-SECOND DAY.)
Polling commenced at nine o'clock this morning. The ap-
pearance of the town was indicative of the interest which the
friends of the several candidates take in the result. The strug-
gle, though short (owing to the operation of the new Act), will
be sufficiently vigorous ; for all chance of coalition between Mr.
Lennard and Mr. Wright, both of whom are Reformers, ap-
peared so wholly impracticable, that the idea was abandoned.
Each candidate relies, therefore, either on his own pretensions,
or the exertions of his personal friends. Mr. Quentin
Dick's declaration in favour of an alteration of the tithe
system, and the abolition of slavery, has gained him many.
In this county, where there are a vast number of influ-
ential Dissenters, it is considered a sine qua non, that every
candidate shall recognise the principle of manumission, inde-
pendent of any collateral question, as to the right of the planters
to compensation ; and, in this particular, the Whig candidates
do not go a jot further than the Conservatives, and some of
the former being lay impropriators of tithes, have fallen into
disrepute, by their unwillingness to give them up. This bo-
rough will certainly return one of'each, owing to disunion
amongst the Reformers themselves. At the close of the poll
the numbers were,

Lennard 378
Dick
Wright
The candidates severally returned thanks, and the poll was
adjourned till eight o'clock to-morrow morning.

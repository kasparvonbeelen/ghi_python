before even a symptom of...it is visible—in the latter
•
case there are frequently very dangerous symptoms.
with Out corresponding danger, in the strength of,,
the rebellious. party. We will illustrate this by •
an example. Combinations of Frame-breakers
might break out in England, or associations of
Ribbonmen or Carders in Ireland, with safety to
the general state (though with much public in-
convenience) ; but such things could. not co-
exist in France with the rule of BuosArAturs..,—
From the throne to the scaffold is an, easy
step to an absolute Monarch. No 'man con-
'versant with 'human feelings,—no man, not blind-
ed by party,—no man at 'all acquainted with
the nature of man, can doubt, but that the
People of France are so much dissatisfieJ with the
NAPOLISON Government, as to be ripe for_, revolt.
The Allies do not wish to conquer them, but to
afford them an opportunity of achieving their own
liberatimi from slavery ; and we; most conscienti-
ously believe that all that is wanting for this
glorious end, is to hoist the White Standard, and
advance in time name of Gnu 4ND 'SAINT Lows.

On the side of Italy, the Austrian arms prOceed
most prosperously. Trieste (reduced! under French
protection from a population of 46,000 to 16,000
inhabitants was surrendered on• the, aot:i Cictn—
ber, and IN pieces of cannon were the fruits of
this important event.
All the territory between the Brento tindthe
Adige is lapsing to its old Sovereign. Patina has
been entered by General STAIIRENBEIZG, and Vi-
cenza by Gen. Eitmtattryr,utitlßzaunAittfots has
been pushed back to 'Verona, where it is supposed
be will cross the river and attempt to defend him-
self. The desertion from his Italian forces is re-
presented as very great. Venice Zvill, of course,
be immediately occupied by the Allies.

DAVOUST is iepolleq to Offered to evacuate

lad refused ; for though'a bridge gold may be
expedient for a flying enemy., we never heard it
recommended in war to make any kind of, a bridge
for an enemy cooped up beyond the possibility of
escape. •

Something of this sort, however, was almost
obtained by the cunning of ST. CYR, at Dresden
but owing to the firmness of Prince ScuwA'RT-
zeßutto,: the in.prudent measure of FLENAU
(which 'smacks woundily of the old system) has
not been confirmed, and GouvioN must. now
fight his way to his master or surrender—sur-

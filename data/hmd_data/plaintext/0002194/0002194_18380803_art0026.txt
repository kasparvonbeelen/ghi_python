with their civil rights, and be able to maintain them
peacefully but firmly, notwithstanding the exertions of the
planters to counteract their liberties, or interfere in any way
with their civil and political freedom.
JOSIA II CON DER, Esq., moved the third resolution. In
doing so he forcibly pointed out how deeply the people of
this country were indebted from the first to the efforts
of Christian Missionaries of various denominations not
only for the good conduct of the Negro population,
but for the originating of that great contest now going on for
upwards of a century, between Christianity and slavery. He
impressed upon the meeting, at the close of his able address,
the necessity of sending agents from the Anti-slavery Socie-
ties of this country, not only to Jamaica, but to the other
Islands to watch over the great experiment of emancipation.
Edward Foster, Esq., of Cambridge, the Rev. T. Morgan,
and other gentlemen, subsequently addressed the meeting,
which broke up about two o'clock.
The important resolutions agreed to upon this interesting
occasion, as also the appeal in behalf of the " Negro Eman-
cipation Schoolâ€¢rooms," the foundation stone of which was
laid by Joseph Sturge, Esq., on the Ist of August, will be
found in our advertising columns.

REN C H PAPERS.

PARIS, SEFT..S.—DEBTS OF THE KING.--The
Chamber of Deputies were this day occupied in
close diseussion. A resolution, as appektred on a
serutinv of the votes, was carried—importing, that
the deGts contracted by the King in foreign cottn-
tries shall be charged to the public treasury. The
Members who voted were 188, .viz, for the reso-
lution 181, against it 7. •
The Prussians have destroyed the column erected
in .honour of l3uonaparte, :in the principal square
at Aix-la-Chapelle. They have rased it to the
very foundation, and have taken away, the gold
and silvCr coin which were placied beneath the
first stone.

Parts, SEPT. 6.—The Austrian army inAtalv
has been reinforced ; all the other -corps of troops
remain on the war footing, and the artillery has
been just supplied with bat-horses and ammuni-
tion, The Bavarian- army remains in a similar
state, and numerous bodies of troops are assembl-
ing on the Meuse. They write from Cassel, that
within these few days orders were given not any
longer to consider the Hessian army as moveable,
but to grant furloughs to a certain number of
Officers and soldiers, and to disband others ; but
two days afterwards another, order- arrived, for-
bidding leave of absence, and commanding the
return of those who had already received them ;
so that the whole army might be ready to march
at the first signal. The Russian artily ,in 'the
vicinity of Hamburgh has received reinforcements,
so that it amounts to 70,000 nren. Some corps
of :this army have penetrated into Hohtein, as far
as the Eider ; they consequently occupy the same
positions as they ilid.beforolieTreaty
in general, the Powers assume a more imposing
'attitude in proportion as the time arrives, which is
definitively to settle the rights of each,of them.—
However it may be, all the German Papers, as
well as our private correspondence, do. not permit
us to doubt that the happiest results will ensue
horn the Congress about to be held at Vienna,—
The most amicable understanding continues to
prevail between theGreit Powers.
Lord Castlereagh arrived at Paris on the 26th
August. He- set off on the 28th, at ten in the
morning, with Mr. Cooke; the Hoder-Secretary
of his Department. This Minister proceeded to
Dijon,to meet Lady Castlereagh.-- He will pro-
bably he at Warsaw on the 15th of September,
where it is supposed arrangements relative to the
future fate of Poland will be made, anterior to
the opening of the Congress at Vienna, which,

This day, alter Mass, Monsieur received the
Duke of Wellington, Ambassador of his Britannic
Majesty. After the audience with Monsieur, his
bxcellency was presented to Madame the Duchess
yf Angonleme.
1-lAmBtrituu, Au°. U.—The finances of this
city are recovering themselves in a manner truly
astonishing. The receipts increase rapidly. Soine
taxes which, the French had formed are retained !
the octroi produces 60,000 florins per month. This
will enable the Government to pay the interest
on the debts of the town, which are three 'years
in arrear ; for these debts were not attended to
from the time 'that the town was united to France;
they, amount to about 50 millions of marks bank°.
It is now in agitation to kittidate these debt:,., by
putting them on the stole Footing as• the English
funds. All the intelligent merchants of Hain-
burgh approve of the project, which will be •
very advantageous to the circulation of the capi-.•
tal, and therefore it will probably be carried into
execution.

PARMA; AuG. 25.—Our regulations are settled.
A great number of Civil Officers are left in their
places.; but their salaries-are much reduced. Th e
revenues of the Civil List, after the proposed re-
ductions, are estimated at 1,900,000 francs.

'GHENT, 2.—The newspnperg have -re-
peatedly assserted, that the Ministers of the
United States have had an interview with Lord
Castlereagh, when be passed through Ghent : they
have added, that since that time the- conferences
have been more frequent, and that the hopes of
peace was, in consequence, nearer. The fact is,
that the American Ministers have bad-no interview
with Lord Castlereagh.

BAYONNE., AUG. 2:8.--The last corps, of English
troops which were encamped in the neighbour-
hood of Bayonne,- quitted the French territory_
o 1 the 25th. They marched to 'Passages, where
they. were to embark.

Immediately after the English troops' had left
the port of Bidassoa, the Spanifirds burnt the
bridge. This measure was probably the conse-
quence of the principle expressed in an article
from Madrid of the 7th August, indicating, that
it was necessary to establish .2 continental and mari-
tisne blockade, to prevent the circulation of news,
.whether real or fabricated, respecting the arrival-of%
King Charles IV. The bridge of the Bidassoa was
the only point of Communicatkin between France
and Spain, by the way'of Bayonne.
Pmus, SEPT. 7.—The .King has promoted to
the rank of Lieutenant-Generals of his Armies,
Marechal-de-Camp the Marquis of Jumilhac, the
oldest surviving superior Officer of the Horse.

oldest of the Officers of the: regiment of Hervilly,

church of St. Leo, for the repose of the soul of
the unfortunate Princess de • Lamhalle. The-

Alanittn, AUG. 25.—In' a dispatch, dated' the

42(1 :tune, from the Spanisii 'l).ot 0 Si.' Domi go,
the Captain General bon C.frlos de Urnitia
in-
fcrtns the Ministers at War that he had sent tai the
Captain General 'of the proi-inee Of Veneznela a
supply, of militiry stores And •coinion, wlach had
arrived safe. ineldses a fetter front the Cap-
tain General of Venezuela, dated the Ist .Toire, in
which the latter announces that the intelligence of
the deliverance of 'Ferdinand VII. had Made the
greatest impression in that country, where affairs,
.both political and military, had tal<en'a more fa-
vourable turn. Colonel Cevallos, Coirtnianaant-
General of the Loyalists, had beaten the principal
Chief of the-rebels of the east, Santiago Marino;
Who hid come with 4000 men from Curnanna and
New Barcelona to relieve Valentia, which was al-
ready invested by 10,000 tnen, and would, Most
probably, soon surrender. The reductilm of the
Caraccas is certain ; and there only,remain to be
subdued the provinces of Cumana and Barcelona,
with the island of St. Margaret.
The King has nominated to the vacant Sees of
Malaga and Leon. .
There has, within these few days„ appeared
here a pamphlet, entitled, " The notorious Trai-
tors 'tvlto have fled to France convicted Of their
Crimes, or an Apology for.the Royal Decree of
the 30th. May." This pamphlet has issued from
the press of the Rbval Printing Office.
LEIPSTC,. AUG 24.---The Russian army has re-
ceived positive orders to evacuate Poland, and to
retire beyond the Niemen within the old Russian
frontier. The head-quarters of Field Marshal
Bat clay de 'Folly are in present at Wartaw.; those
of General Langerou were for some days at Cra-
cow, whence he has just departed for Russia. All
the Russian troops continue their retrograde
movement, front which politicians augur favour-
ably. a .

The Duke de Hijar is here constantly, and
there is no prOSpect of his speedydeparture for
Paris.

11.ATISBON, AUG. 3l.—There is a report at Ilil-
desheitn, 'that the Prince ,Regent of Englund will
re-establish the English Abbey of Benedictines,
situate at Lamspring, a few leagues front this
city.—The Prince has yielded to the solicitations.
of the English Catholic Clergy. Several Bede=
siastics, both English and Irish, have been brought
up at this celebrated Abbey.

HAGUE, AUG. 31.—Our marine now reckons,
besides, Lieut.-Admiral Kingsbergen, eight Vice-
Admirals, five Commanders, forty-one Captains,
542 Lieutenants of different classes. .

HOME, AI)G: W.—Though there is already a
great number of foreign troops in the Ecclesiasti-
cal States, 8000 troops, who have already set out
fr-om Naples, are expected to arrive 'here. The
Romans look on these measures with a suspicions
eye .; and the castle of St:Angelo in particular,.
which is still composed of foreign troops, excites'
their doubts and dissatisfaction.
AuGusT2o.---The health of his-Holiness is cOrn-,

Ate,-.' 19. --L. Frcderistcin has
been evacuated by our troops, who were to enter
Chistiania on the 15th. The greatest harmony
reigns hetWeen the Norwegian and Swedish mili-
tary. The first care of our Government, when
things took a favourable turn in Norway, was to
give orders to transport thither a considerable
vAantity of grain of every kind. In Norway there
was an absolute went" of g'oon• bread, and the Nor-
wegians will no doubt he sensible of the exertions
made by his Majesty to supply this want.,

(From the Awl.' de Paris)
ST. DOMINGO AND THE SLAVE-Til ADE.

The Chamber of Commerce of the town ..pf
Nantes has just published some Observations-On'
the Slave Trade, and the restoration of St. Do.,
ming°, of which yve think it our duty to ppesent
the substance.

It would be impracticable either to re-people
or re-cultivate St. Domingo without the Skive •
Trade : this is an acknowledged truth. ' The
Foropeans, who settle there, to exercise employ-
Anent, which rcquire little fatigue, find it difficult
to preserve (11;14, health., even in easy circum-
stances ; how then could they resist the effects of
the climate, if they applied to agriculture, like the
peasantry of Europe ? Strong and vigorous men
are there necessarily required ; men also born in
a hot climate ; and negroes alone unite both these
advantages.
1 - DOubtless on the first settlement of colonies,
and when negroes were first imported, a
.mild re-
gime7ought to have been established, and of such -
a kind that after a certain nuniber of years the
laborious and economical slave Might have been'
able to purchase his liberty. Nay, doubtless, says
the Nantes Chamber of Commerce, the cupidity
of . the first merchant who engaged in the Slave
Trade ought to have been proscribed ; but it has
existed for ages, and the systems cannot be sud-
denly changed, or you must renounce the colonies,
which would be to abandon a balance of 70 -mil-
lions in favour of France, to dirminish the revenues
of the State in the proportion of that traffic ; and
thns by impoverishing France, endanger her poli-
tical liberty ; for experience, proves that in the
present '•state of Europe the great Powers cannot
maintain it but by a great mass of wealth.
Is it not commerce, and its incalculable gains,
which give to England, at-this day, an influence
every where so considerable ? Doubtless, Pus- •
sesse.d of ,Bengal and India, she might dispense
with American colonies, and furnish alone to Eu-'
rope, not only all' the territorial and manufactured
'productions of Asia, and its isles, hut even all the
produce of. America. But is this a reason why
we, who have next to nothing in India, we who
can establish there no competition with the Eng 7
fish—we who cannot like them subject the inha-
bitants .of
.those regions to a dependence almost
equivalent to slavery; is this a reason why we should
have no American colonies ? Should there be only
one nation in the world that carried on Trans-
atlantic navigation, and the trade in colonial pro,
duce ? The execution of this project would place
Europe and the whole world, at the discretion Of
England. "

worthy of the intelligence of the age in
which we live to labour for the Abolitifin of the
Slave Trade, but in such away as not to ruin the
.cations which, carry it on ; ,and before 'bewailing

" CHARLES JEAN."

The French Papers are to the Bth. An article
of the 6th, which we obsefve has attracted consi-
derable attention as it treats of the imposing atti-
tudes assumed by the Powers about to meet in
Congress, does not seem t0.,-us to be worth so
much notice—it is merely a paraphrase of news,
which we have ourselves imported before from
Hamburgb. The evacuation of Poland by the
Russian troops is a measure of great import—it
indicates, we hope, the re-establishmentpf that
-Country as an independent Kingdom. Poland,
it is true,
,can never he very strong and powerful,
perhaps not happier in this enntlition, than as an
appendage to a mighty Empire ; but her integrity
is calculated to preserv'e the repose of Europe,
her geographical position interposing between all
the sharp angles where 'Austrian, Russian and
Prussian politics, might clash and set the,Continent
in flames.

These Papers
,contain a singular publication
from Nantes, upon the Slave Trade. Upon this
question we have said little. We pitied the
amiable enthusiasm by which many of -our coub-
trytnen were misled to petitioning, by a cunning
Faction, who feeling themselves too weak .to as,
sail their successful rivals on the glorious Treaty
they had concluded, and a►ot diuing openly to at-
tack them, adopted this mode of disparaging
a part of their, work, by a despicable: side-
wind. We did hope that this mistaken coq se
would .not be so generally pursued as to excite
the jealousy of the French people, and necessarily
render the attempts of our Go►ernment to pro-
cure the entire abolition of slavery more difficult
of execution ; and we deeply lament to know that

such has been the effect of most ii judicious
hu-
manity ! There was no need for, these petitions—,
they could do no good—they must tend to de-
feit the very object pretended to be desired by
their framers. Did we knov: so little of nature
as to imagine, that extreme' anxiety for a poli-
tical measure expressed by the people of England,
would be the likeliest mode of inducing, similar
and corresponding sentiments in the people of
Trance ? If so, we were unwise—the earnest re-
commendations of 'the entire French' Nation
would not incline us one whit the more to give
up Malta or Gibraltar, to surrender India to its
natives, or grant the CatholickS of Ireland their
coveted supremacy over the Protestant Church.
It is because we are real friends to the aboli-
tion of slavery that we ever have and ever shall
regret the steps taken by many well-disposed but'
misguided friends to that measure in this country.
With regard to the Nantes article, considering it
as the production of interested French merchants

(and remembering, what Liverpool and other Bri-
tish Ports said, not a hundred years ago), we think
there is much reason in it—that it is in many
points unanswerable.

We have Hamburg!) and Gottenburgh Mails.
There is a rumour from Elsineur of a new con-
test having arisen in Norway, which we discredit.
The Duke of CumBERLAND was married at New
Strelitz on the With ult. to the Princess of SALMS.
His Royal Highness and his beautiful Bride were
expected immediately at Hanover.

We insert a few further particulars respecting
the action between the Mop and ...iron. The Cork
Advertiser, in a Seco9d Edition of the 6th, says
the Avon had 18 killed and several wounded. It
adds,
" We are happy to hear that Captain ARBUTHNOT, of the.
Aeon, though wounded in both legs, is not dangerously so;
the Second Lieutenant is wounded, but it is hoped not badly.
They were both landed at Core this day."

It was reported on Saturday, that an action.
had been fought upon the
.Lakes between our flo-
tilla and the America, in which'we were com-
pletely successful, and that a large detachment of
the British army co-operated with onr•flotilla.
Accounts from the i7lavannah state, that the
frigate La Prneva had reached that port with tier
convoy, and the dispatches she conveyed to the
Governor. Admiral APODACA had appeased the
public mind, ‘vhicli was in a state of fermentation
on account of the contradictory reports frsrin Eu-
rope. It Was•- not before known whether the
(.'tortes or FERDINAND had prevailed ; and it was
apprehended that the country from Cadiz to the
Pyrenees vas torn and destroyed by civil discen-
sions. The authority of FRitDINAND is now per-
pc. ctly re-established on the Island of Cuba.

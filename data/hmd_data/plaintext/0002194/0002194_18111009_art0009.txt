py our unfortunate country are kept in continual

which means it is equally impossible to ascertain their

to be concentrated. Report estimates the former,

including the Saxon and confederate troops, at
130,000 men. ' On our parts, the desire is still for

HiI;SINGBURGEI, SEPT. 27.—According to the re-
port uf travellers It uto the opposite shore, his
Majesty accompanied by' the Royal Goa'di,

has left the capital for the'purpose of proceeding to
Hatuburgh where his Majesty will have an inter-
view with the Emperor
PANSCPWA, Aug. I9.—The last intelligence from
Belgrade informs us that the Bov:i:in Corps as"
serntiled neat Traunick and the Drina have suddenly
and entirely disappeared.
,T4e corps of 3,000 men which madq irrup-
lion into Servia, have also retired, dragging with

them into slavery the. inhabitants of the villages they
hat) pillaged. We in reali!y know nothing of the
direction this corps has taken. All Servia is in a
flight, for it the nussians lose a battle, the tate of
this Province will be'clreadlut.

They write from Orsowa, that all communication
between Weddin and New Orsowa has been in-

terrepted for three weeks. The corps of. General
SASS has been forced, to quit Timok,'ititl is now en-
campe'd before Cladova ; 10,000 Rnssians are on
Mount Alien, upon the other side of the chain of
mountains, and several thousands.iof Russians hate
already arrived at Crajowa.
A report 'has been general for some days, that.
many strange Turks hart arrived at Weddin. Yes;
terday similar intelligence on good authority was re-
ceived frotn..Belgrade. It is therefore contirtited,
that lsm3il, Bey of Seres, has at rived-at Werldin Wiili
a corps of from fez, .Co 30,000.tnen.

Vflt aid, q.crr. 4.—Letters from Constantinople,
dated the beginning of August, give fresh details
respetting the affairs of iludsChuck,. the results of
which we have already stated. General G. Ku-,
TUSOW .h:iving learned that the'. Grand Vizier
marched in mass against him; detached at first a
-
corps of twelve thousand • men, which engaged
the Turkish advanced guard at Kradekeiv©, three
leagues from Rudschuck. • This corps was obliged
to Jail 'back upon the . entrenchments of San
Bain: two days after the 'Turks forced these
trenclunents, and pursued the Russians- under the
cannon of the fortress, and on the gth of July; at...-
tempted the assault, but
iwere‘ repulsed by the Rus-
sians, who had the honour of viabl. Neverthe-
less the General in Chief, seeing that in the end his
efforts would be unavailing; determined to evacuate
the place, in order to save his baggage, and artillery ;
the 'Turks* perceived his intention, and advanced
-with such itnpetuosity that a great part of the
enemy's train fell into their hands. The passage of
the Danube alone cost the Russians 800 men, and
many, cannon, which the conquerors every day con-
tinue to diag out of that river.
' The Grand Vizier has 'since, advanced towards
Giurgewo.

JASS)4 AUG. 18,—Ti.velve Cossa4 regiments
have been ordered to join the Russian Army. They
have already passed through our to%D.
The 1.5t11 division, under the orders of Lieut. Gen.
I.llAstr.ow ; and the gth, commander! by Generd
JARMELETT, which were encamped near Jassy,
have also set out,. •

VIENNI, SETT. best informed persons
assure us, that the Hungarians I.vere never animated
with s better, hinrit, and that there nip longer exits
any trace of that. ancient animosity arising from
a crowd
_of pretensions .always fatal to the
public good. We kno‘ii how boisterous the Hun-
garian diets In bten, and how frequently they
have disputed .111eic Mutialch's atitho:ity. We are
persuaded that . the present condu& of the Arch-.
duke Palatine, has, greatly contributed to obtain 1T
Government the loge and confidence of the
Earicrirs.

In the Bannatund _frontier prminees Which un-
der the political report, constitute past of the Hun-
garian kingdom, then provincial assemblies have held
their meetings with much calinnesii,. and public
opinion is every where decideuiy in favour of Go-
vernment.

7'ROi7ER'S MEMOIRS OF MR. FOX.",.

It4TERVIIIO/:WITH ARTHUR O'CONNOR, AT CALMS.
An incident occurred at Cal tis, which, as it ex-
cited much remark, and rodsed a good deal of cen-
sure at the time, I should advent to. more at length
than would otherwise be necessary. It happened
that Mr. A. O'Connor had arrived at the Inn at
which 'We stopped, very shorty befote: He, waited
On 11,Tr. Fox,—Was received by him with that urba-
nity and openness' whichdistingUishetl him, and was
invited to dinner by him, Which invitation he ac-
cepted o(, I had never seen thiS Gentleman before;
It is well known that after a long -confine-client atFort -1
George, he and 'smite other Irish Gentlemen
hadagreed with the Irish Goveinment.to expatriate
'theinsel‘es for lire. Mr. O'Connor was now on his
way tn. Prris accordingly, when chance brought him
to Quilliac's Jan,' at tho same time with Mr. Fox.
His 111,10ners were extremely pleasing ; Ad, with-
out entering into any eiscus.ion ni Irish politics in
the unhappy times in Ireland preceding and follow-
ing the year 17ga, i May risk the assepion, that,
is 'an Irish Gentleman, and an unto!tunate
elite
(and all wtio are- compelled to leave their cottony
are un!ortunate), he was entitled to prilitettess,
hu-
minify, and even courrhiseration. Perfectly Uncon-
nected with Got:eminent, and travelling as any other
English Geuti .inan of noble birth,- Mr. Fox found
no difficulty. in receiving this Gentleman (whom he
had known before he was 8,, deeply iinnliCated in
Irish politics) . a friendly imd ciniSohng wel
conic. Mi. • O'Connar dined with us; and. I, for
one, was tnttch pleased wit Ii his. deportment and
manner., though I could not become a convert to
his arguments, to prove that his part}, hid not at-
tempted or desired tir.rouse the ptlsical strength of
his country to riled a change in Ireland'.

LONDON MAXEITS.
(Frens the London New Price Current of yesterday.)
SUGAR. -The stock of West India Sugar is so. much
reduced, that it was anerrtained last week that only about
2,000 hhds. and trs. remained in the importers' hands;
there were, in consequence, few Sugars offering for•stile,
tnd the estimated purchases of the week did not exceed
1,200 hhds. and trs.: several boards realized Very.higlr
prices, but no general advance could be stated. The
stock of Sugar is very much reduced ; the stock of West
India Sugar in London is now 8,488 hhds. and trs.,
which is 4,669 less than last year. The stock of Mau-
ritius is 28,246 bags, being 43,441 less than last year.
The deliveries are of course very limited; last week the
delivery of West India Sugar was 2,104 hhds. and trs,,
which is 72 less than last year. The delivery of
Mauritius was .6,302 bap, which is 3,407 less than the
corresponding week of 1830. The estimated sales this
day were only 200 hhds. and trs., and there are now only
about 500 hhds: and trs. in London in the importers'
hands. There were feW buyers of refined goods for ex-
pcirt during the last week ; the holders, however, did
mit press sales, and there was no alteration in the ter-
recy. The requett.for the borne consumption was ani-
mated, the prices were ls,,i a 2S. advanced. This after...,
noon there is again mote demand for refined goods for
export on account of•tfie orders by the mails arrived:
Lumps go off freely at 645.
:FOREIGN SUCIARS.-By public sale last weed "202
ttiet.ts Brazil Sugars, mostly Rios, sold at former prices,
white 25a. a 29a. 6d. a few Baliias, low to mid. white
255. a 295. 6d., and Pernama 28s. and 28s. 6d. This
tlOy's_ public sale 244 whole .6 half chests Brazil sugar,
the Rios sold higher, ord. white 255. a 271.,
.good
white. 28s. a 295., fine 30s. 'a 31s. ; the Bakias were of
inferior quality.
EAST INDIA Sucon.s.-The Only sale last week, 840
bags Bengal, went off at former prices. This dty 578
bags Mauritius sold heavily at previous prices..-Average
price of Sugar 265. Id. per cwt. .
COFFEE.-There was no alteration in the Coffee market
last week: the British Plantation descriptions continue
neglected, as the Supply at market is confined to parcels
not suitable for the home trade, and the wholesale grocers
wait for the new supplies ; the parcels sold last week
were .at former prices, but a good proportion was taken
in. There were no public sales this day, but the demand
'by private contract is most extensive; about 2,000 bags
Brazil have been sold 41s. up to 425.' 6d., and several
large parcels are offered for, and will probably be taken
before the conclusion of the day ; 435. is asked for co.
loury Brazil; 425. has been realized for St. Domingo; we
have no ordinary Jamaica on sale ; the only Coffee neg-
lected is the middling and finer descriptions, some inquiry
for East India Coffee, and some parcels of Java are
.jut
now reported sold.
Rum, IlluinY, AND HOLLANDS.-The Rum market
was very dull last week, the only parcels ,of any extent'
were strong Jamaica and Demerara, of the latter 35 over
sold at 2s. sd. In Brandy or Geneva there is no alteration.
Hx.mr, F_LAX, AND TALLOW.-The Tallow market re-
mains in a nominal state, for parcels on the spot there is
little or no business doing ; for arrival 40s. a 395. 6d. has
been repeatedly paid. In Hemp or Flax there is no ma-
terial alteration.
IRISH Poovrsiotss.The Butter as well as the Bacon
Market is in a very depressed state ; of the former the im-
port of Irish last week was 6,305 firkins, and of Foreign
3,086 casks, the price of Irish generally may be notni-
nally quoted BSs. a 995. per cwt. as to quality. The im-
port of Bacon was considerable during the week (say
9,555 bales), with a further arrival to-day of 2,000 or
3,000 bales, prime singed Waterford 405., and Belfast bale
middles 475. a 48s. landed, with very little disposition to
purchase, except by those necessitated, lower prices being
looked for from the unprecedented weight of stock.
INDIGO.-This day 502 chests Company's have passed
the sale, and sold with great spirit at the following ad-
vance on the price of last sale ; low ordinary qualities
40. 64., good consuming qualities to middling shipping
ditto 6d. a 9d., good shipping qualities 9d., fine
.ditto,
3.1. a 6d. With the exception of a small proportion
Fanlight by home trade, the whole appears to be taken for
export. The prices paid to-day are as follow :-Low to
ordinary qualities 3d. a 3.5. 10d.; goOil consuming quali-
ties to middling shipping ditto 3s. 10d. a 4s. 9d. good
shipping qualities ss. a ss. 9d., fine ditto 6s. a 7s. Id.
Woot.-The market is very flat, the merchants hold-
ing firmly to prices, and the buyers as firmly refraining
from all purchases, except such as they are from necessity
obliged to make.
SiLx.-The Silk market is flat, no iteration since last
week's prices.

HOUSE OF LORDS, Amu. 12.

The House met to-day, pursuant to adjournment, at
lialf-past Three o'clock.
Prayers were read by the Bishop of BRISTOL.
Lord WYNFOBD took his seat on the Woolsack, in the
absence of the Lord Chancellor, as Deputy Speaker.
Mr. Foster, from the Trustees of the Liverpsol Docks,
presented accounts pursuant to Act of Parliament.

TO TIIE FREEHOLDERS OF THE COUNTY OF
SUSSEX.

GENTLEMEN,
IN consequence of the lamented Death of
your late excellent Member Mr. BURRELL, I am
induced to offer myself as a Candidate for the honour of
succeeding hint, and I do so with feelings of no ordinary
confidence, arising from the numerous and flattering as-
surances of active support which I receive from all parts
of the County.
Having for many years had a seat hr Parliament, my
public conduct and principles cannot be altogether un-
knov.-ta to you. Still, however, I feel that you have a right
to expect an explicit avowal of the grounds upon which I
rest my pretensions to your favour.
I shall not indulge in extravagant professions, but of
this you may rest aaured—that I shall always be found a
steady and detertnined advocate for every possible Retrench-
went in the Public Expenditure, and an uncompromising
enemy of abuses of whatever kind, and proceeding from
whatever quarter.
I am a sincere friend to the agriculturist, but at the same
time I shalt always bear in mind what is due to other
great interests.

I abhor slavery, and shall be ever ready to lend my
best assistance towards ameliorating the condition of the
unfortunate Negro.
_ _

Although I have very lately expressed before many of
you my sentiments on the aplan of Reform which the
Ministers of the Cr.iwn have submitted to Parliament, I
am nevertheless sensible that on an occasion like the pre-
sent I ought not to pass over silently so important a topic.
No one can approve of that great measure more than I do.
It has already received, and will continue to receive,
my most zealous suppm t. I consider it a measure of
conservation, and I am satisfied that, should it happily
become a law, it will raise the character of the House of
Commons—promote harmony and good will among the
different otders of the State—and give stability to the
Throne itself.

I shall only add that, should I by your kindness be
honoured with the high trust to which I aspire, you shall
not find me deficient in zeal—however humble my abili-
ties—either in discharging the general duties of a Member
of Parliamen,, or in promoting the particular interests of
the County.
I have the honour to be, Gentlemen,
With every sentiment of respect,
Your very faithful and obedient servant,
JOHN GEORGE LENNOX
Albion Hotel, Brighton, April 9, 1831.

Now there is no man more entitled to a Baronetcy than
the present LORD MAYOR, and there is no city magistrate
on whom it could be conferred with so much satisfaction
to the citizens as his Lordship. But what has Alderman
THOMPSON done to entitle himself to such an honour? As
a politician he did all that he could do, before he found
that his seat would be endangered by his proceedings, to
defeat the Reform Bill, and consequently to embarrass his
Majesty's Ministers. Conduct like this is not usually re-
warded with the honours of the Crown. It is true he
voted for the Bill, hut we believe that the merit of this act
is wholly due to the constituents, not to the representa-
tive, of the city of London.—Morning Paper.

NORWICH, April 9.
We continue to have a limited quantity Wheat from the
farmers, which, with a proportion of foreign on sale makes a
moderate supply. The condition of our farmers' Wheat is im.
proved, and dry samples sell readily at last week's prices, other
sorts are dull of sale. There is but little Barley at market, and
.the price remains unaltered. Oats, Beans, and Pease, are with.
out variation. Flour is steady.

A most numerous and highly respectable
meeting was holden at the Hop•pole inn, in Tewkesbury,
on Wednesday last, for the purpose of forming a district
committee, to assist in effecting the return of an indepen-
dent representative for this county, in the place of Lord
EDWARD SOMERSXT, on the ground of his opposition to
the Bill for Parliamentary Reform. Resolutions to that
effect were unanimously agreed to. The meeting was ad-
dressed by several gentlemen, in energetic speeches ; and
but one sentiment appeared to pervade the assembly, which
was an overwhelming one in fiVour of the Ministerial plan
of Reform.— Gloucester Journal.

CANTERBURY, April 9.
The supply of Wheat this day was very short, and from Is. to
2s. per quarter cheaper. Barley, Beans, and Oats, were unal
tered in value.

nor will they be less touched liv the sacrifices
the ladies of Warsaw to relieve them. 1:rocelo made by
subscriptions will be immediately set on footubf large
for that
purpose : " From Poland, March, IS3I.
" Imagine, my Lord, the state of Warsaw : the houses
of the persons of the first rank are filled by the wounded
that are brought in after each day's, battle; nay, even the
streets are filled with them, and ladies of the highest
rank,
in the midst of the inclemency of the winter, have
attended, and still attend them, dress their wounds, fore
surgical aid is greatly wanting, and. give them all that
consoling assistance that femile benevolence alone per_
haps can suggest ; arid what is still more beautiful, the
Russian wounded that fall in the neighbourhood of War-
saw receive the same humane attention, for with the
Poles, as with the English, a fallen foe is no 'longer an
enemy. The ladies of Warsaw have sold all 'their rings,
plate, &c., have renounced all their acenatomed luxuries
of 'life, living principally upon kassika (boiled grain,
prepared with milk or butter), and making every sacri-
fice worthy of Roman matrons, to relieve their suffering
countrymen. But conceive, my Lord, what' must be
their dread, surrounded by so powerful an etiemy, should
Warsaw fall into such barbarous hands. On each day of
battle the women of Warsaw, of all ranks, prostrat,
themselves, with their faces to the ground, within and
without the churches, to obtain the protection of Heaven.
Let our country, my Lord, be the band of Providence to
,save those who so well deserve protection."

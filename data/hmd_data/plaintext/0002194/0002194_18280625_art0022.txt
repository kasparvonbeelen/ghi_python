STATE .OF THE REPRESENTATION.
Mr. A. BARING rose to give notice of a niotioo,
in some degree connected with the Members of dr:
House, and still more with the 'privileges of ,jtti
Members. He was sorry that. the advanced per j,
of the Session precluded the possibility of he
bringing the subject fairly before the House, bttt
could not avoid, even then, drawing the attention °
its Members to a system which began to prevailtl::
some extent, and through the operation of
the East India. Company were able to reduce "1(
number of its Members, and to leave many plat°
• very considerable importance without any represe;
tation. He conceived that the. continuance 0i."! r,
power in the hands of the East India CoMpinf,
draw away the Members of that- House fro':'
the performance of their duties to their .Corlsr
tuents, was highly objectionable, and even dile
gerous—and that, at all events, it Was quite
inconsistent with all the principles upon which 6
House of Representatives, for the performance
of legislative duties, could possibly he f°r°ll,
ed. In noticing this circumstance, he could sO"
deny that his .attention was particularly directed-to
the subject from' perceiving that the city of Canter"'
bury was not represented in that House. It Wl'
then too late in-tlie Session to think of bringirtfEitit
any Bill with the hope of its passing into a law ; btt
if no other 1-1,,n. Member took the matter under hil
consideration, and if he had the honour"of a.seet i°
that House rinring.the next Session, he proposed t°
bring in a Bill, of which he now gave notice, re;
quiring Members of Parliament to vacate their Wit
upon accepting offices in India. •
Notice for next Session. •
ADMIRALTY COURT (IRELAND); ,h,
Sir J. NEWPORT begged to know, whetbet.
Right Hon. Gentleman opposite (Mr. Serretti'lf
Peel) had received the Report of the Commissiur°?,
Inquiry into the State of the Admiralty Court iv,'"
Ireland, and whether at the same time there evae
return to the Motion for the Report of the.Couswril
sion appointed- to inquire into the State ofthe DO°
Police ?
Mr. Secretary PEEL was unable to give any posjr:
tive answer. He expressed his intention, bower
to make similar inquiries.
STATE OF PORTUGAL. .
Lord JOHN RUSSELL, seeing theßighaleil:,.
Gentleman (Mr. Secretary Peel) in his place,
re'
to ask a question of very great importance. with
gard to the situation of this country in its fore g°
relations. He meant in its relations with.the u:°-0
vernnient of Portugal. It was unfortunately but 1° t
notorious that the person who at the present moll°
held the situation of the Regent of that kingdolll'
had not only destroyed the Constitutional Chttr,te;
but violated the oath which he had solemnly tal,
to observe its conditions as they regarded the pe°P t
of Portugal. It was not his purpose on the prey °f
occasion to make any comments upon the nature 00
these transactions. It was sufficient, perhaps' t,
observe, that no former period of history could prof
sent to view a person guilty of an equal extent 1?
crime, either as his conduct regarded the nation
over which he was deputed to rule, or as it waif
connected with the Pringe to Whom ke owe
allegiance.—(Hear, hear, hear.)—Upon this est°
of things, however, a question naturally arises, •wile't
ther it was riot the duty of the Government 0
this country to order its Arnbassador immediately tv.,
quit the capital of Portugal. While the inteutior
of the Regent, were doubtful, ii was • probably iiff

A a MEETING NEGRO of the EMAN-
rx CIPATION COMMITTEE, held at No. 25, Tokenhouse-
aid, on TUESDAY the 17th July, 1838,
GEORGE STACEY, Esq., in the Chair,
It was tmattimously resolved—
That this Committee while they congratulate the Anti-Slavery
Public on the probable speedy extinction of the oppressive system
of Negro Apprenticeship throughout the British Colonies, would
affectionately but seriou'ly remind the friends of justice and hu-
manity that their work is not yet done—that in many of our Colo-
nies t he cape etedlibertv of the longstifferitig. negolroivieb iy thti
llbeei,mzaisnte,tpiteh.:
eedonger, d at the expliatibti bi hie apprentict
ration of specious Colonial Laws, which already exist, of sfhich are
proposed under various pretexts, the effect of which will be, if
tolerated, to establish a scheme of legalised despotism in the Colo-
nies, that will defeat the just expectations of the friends of the
slave, and prove that the liberty obtained for the negro with so
much anxiety, cost, and exertion, will be but a mockery of freedom.
That deeply impressed with the paramount importance of this
matter at this particular crisis, the Committee have received with
great satisfaction and pleasure an Address recently published by
the anti-slavery Society in Aldermanbury, which clearly
sets forth the impending danger to the premised liberty of the
oppressed negro, and while they pledge themselves cordially to
co-operate in promoting the adoption of such measures as may be
deemed best calculated to secure the full and unqualified enjoyment
of freedom to the Negro, they would earnestly, solicit in this effort
the support of their friends in all parts of the United Kingdom.
That the Committee regard the case cf the Hottentots in the
Cape Colony (until relieved by a Proclamation in their favour
in the year 1829) as a striking illustration of what nominal free-
men may become in a Colony where pro-slavery prejudice
exists. 'these ill-fated aborigines, by a system of oppressive legis-
lative enactments, were reduced to so abject a state of bondage,
that Colonel Wade, the late acting Governor of the Cape, de-
scribed it as follows:—" From all I have been able to learn, the
state of the slaves was a thousand times preferable, in every point
of view, to that of this unhappy race, who amounting at the very
least to a fourth part of the whole free population of the settlement,
were held in the most degrading thraldom by their fellow-subjects,
at the same time that both Dutch and English Governments over
and over again admitted, and by the strangest of all inconsistencies,
admitted it in the very proclamations and ordinances, in which
their compulsory servitude was provided for, that the Hottentots
were a free people. From the withering effects of this bondage
(in truth, I know not how to designate so monstrous an anomaly)
the 50th Ordinance was intended to emancipate them."
That in the opinion of this Committee a repeal of all existing
Colonial enactments which apply directly, or which are in their
practical operation calculated to affect principally the labouring
population, and that with the establishment of a cote of equal laws,
the appointment of humane and impartial men in the judicial and
executive departments of the Governments of our Colonies is
equally necessary, for securing the rights and privileges of the
Coloured classes.

INSOLVENT DEBTOR'S COURT.

IN RE CHARLES SAMUEL EDISON.

The insolvent was opposed on Saturday by a creditor
in person, named Peake, for a debt of 201. From his ex-
amination it appeared that he had been a clerk for a
number of years in the Lord Chamberlain's Office, St.
James's Palace, where he rose to a salary of 550/. a year.
Being in debt to various creditors to the amount of more
than 4,0001., they memorialised the Lord Chamberlain,
and he was discharged froth his office, to which cause he
attributed his insolvency. He bad offered, he said, 10s.
in the pound on the faith of his salary, which had been re-
fu-A by his creditors.
The creditor (Mr. Peake) said he wished to be in-
formed whether he was not to be reinstated in his office
after he was discharged by this Court, to which he replied
in the negative. fie had nothing to give up to his credi-
tors but some debts, amounting to about 6001.
After some amendments made to his schedule, he was
ordered to be discharged.

POLICE INTELLIGENCE.

BO W-STREET.

THE CIDER CELLARS.â€”Mr. Rhodes, the proprietor of
the Cider Cellars in Maiden-lane, was summoned by In-
spector Medlicott, of the F division of Police, for
keeping open lis house after twelve o'clock on the night of
Saturday, the 29th of December. Mr. Rhodes at once
admitted the fact as stated by the police ; but in answer
to the charge said that on the night in question there
were upwards of eighty gentlemen in his coffee-room,
all of whom, with the exception of three or four, left the
house the moment the clock struck twelve. He was in the
habit of engaging a set of professional singers to amuse
his customers, and on the close of the evening's entertain-
ment to give them a supper after his house was closed for
the evening. He did so on the night in question, and, with
the exception of the singers, and three or four of his privote
friends, there were no persons in his house at the time the
police entered it. He closed the doors at twelve o'clock.
'f he Adelphi Theatre did not close on that night until
half-past twelve o'clock ; and, although his house was next
door to it, and hundreds of persons afterwards applied for
admission, he refused to let in any one of them. The
company frequenting his coffee-room were persons of the
highest respectability, and he could not turn them out by
force while in the act of taking their supper.
Mr. JARDINE said the law was imperative on the sub-
j,et i but as he was satisfied the defendant's house was re-
spectably conducted, and there was nothing alleged against
it by the police beyond the particular offence for which the
defendant was summoned, he thought that the justice of
the case would be fully answered by his fining the defen-
dant 53., but without costs.
Defendant immediately paid the fine.
[These fines for some weeks have been becoming less
aid less, and are now beautifully small. Mr. Hall, the
Chief Magistrate, fined the same defendant 51. and costs
far the first offence, and Mr. Jardine has reduced the fine
to ss, without costs. What a satire on Magistrates' Law,
and on the religion of the country ! The pantomime not
over 6;1 half-past twelve, no sin in that, but a grievous
sin to break the Sabbath by giving drink to persons almost
from thirst. If the inhabitants of London submit
perishing
to this tyranny they should never be allowed to quench
their thirst but at a pump. A case followed this which Mr.
Jardine with equal good sense.. dismissed. An information
had been laid by the police against the landlord of the
Fshmongers' Arms, in West-street, St. NTartin's-lane, for
suffering gaming in his house.â€”Mr. Jardine said he would
never convict in such a case, unless it was proved that the
ii,,sties were playing for money or money's worth, and, ac,
cording,ly, in the absence of such proof, dismissed the case.

MARLBOROUGH-STREET.
FEROCIOUS Dons.-Mr. W. M. Tracy, of No. 2, Cork-
tfcet, summoned Mr John Limbert, grocer, Tottenham-
,,,ort-road, before Mr. Dyer, for having a ferocious dog at
large, unmuzzled.
Mr. Tracey said he was passing along Great Russell-
street, a day or two ago, with his two boys, when a
bull terrier, which was running after a cart, snapped at
the children. Fortunately the children contrived to escape
toe danger. The dog then attacked a gentleman, Mr.
ilothery, proctor, Doctors' Commons, and tore his coat,
Afterwards the dog attacked a gentleman named Smith,
one of the partners in Nleux's Brewery, and tore
his trousers, and then the animal tried to bite a female,
but she luckily escaped with the loss of a portion of her
dress. Further mischief was prevented by an appeal to a
policeman, and measures were then determined to have
the matter brought before a Magistrate.
Mr. Rothery confirmed the statement of the complainant.
Mr. Tracey said he was surprised Mr. Smith had not
come forward, as he had promised to do when appealed to.
Mr. Limbert expressed his sorrow for what had oc-
curred, and promised to take precautions to prevent any-
thing of the sort again taking place.
Mr. DYER, after remarking on the danger of allowing
ferocious dogs to go at large in the public streets, in-
flicted the reduced fine of 205., which was immediately
paid.

issued from the Horse Guards, prohibiting the practice

Falmouth ;" and officers are enjoined to prevent letters of
a private nature from being inclosed under official covers.

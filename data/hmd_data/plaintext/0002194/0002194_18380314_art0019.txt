s trength. Several of the masters told their apprentices
that no mercy would be shown to children born free, and
that their mothers would not be allowed the time neces-
sary to suckle them. Among the planters likely to obtain
an everlasting notoriety for the unjust oppression of the
apprentices, we must place on record, the name of Mr.
SE NIOR, and hismaiden sister, whose treatment of the coloured
race, male and female, will form one of the darkest
pages in the annals of slavery. It is not a little remark-
able, that before the passing of the Emancipation Act Mr.
SENIOR was considered a kind master, and never systema-
tically oppressed his slaves before the Ist of August, 1834.
From that day he tortured them without limitation or
mercy, and vowed in their hearing, that he would disable
them for life before the expiration of the period of appren-
ticeship. Hitherto many of the Magistrates, as appears
from the documents before us, have shamefully neglected to
do their duty ; and their intimacy with the planters, whose
guests they often are when trying the apprentices, is cal-
culated to add to the impression of their partiality enter-
tained by nineteen-twentieths of the coloured population.
But if all that is desirable cannot be done—if it be found
impracticable to terminate the period of apprenticeship
before 1840—the Goverement is in duty bound to abolish
the flogging- of women ; to classify and define the offences
for which the apprentices of either sex shall be sent to the
tread-mill; to regulate the motion of the wheel ; and to
insist upon the roof Eng, ventilating, and enlarging of the
prisons—and such, to a great extent, are the humane
objects contemplated by Lord GLENELG'S Bill. We
must also do the Noble Colonial Secretary and
his Excellency, the present Governor-General of Ja-
maica, Sir LIONEL SMITH, the justice to say, that the do-
cuments before us supply ample evidence of their mutual
exertions to ameliorate the condition of the apprenticed la-
bourers. On the part of both, there is a constant leaning
in favour of the people of colour, from a humane appre-
ciation of the helplessness of their condition ; and we are
happy to see, that one of the results of this system has been
to inspire the negroes with unbounded confidence in the
justice of the Imperial Legislature. We can have no doubt
but that Lord GLENELG is willing to do all in his power to
abolish slavery, though deterred by his fears from the prompt
adoption of the measures requisite for that purpose.

The Paris Journals of Monday have been received, but
their contents are utterly devoid of interest.

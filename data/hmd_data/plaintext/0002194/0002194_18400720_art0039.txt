HORRIBLE MURDER, AND SUL-

CIDE OF THE MURDERER.

This morning, about a quarter to ten o'clock, the neigh-
bourhood of St. George's_road, Lambeth, was plunged
into the most painful state of excitement upon learning,
that a murder had taken place at No. 4, Caroline-build-
ings, in that vicinity ; anti that the murderer, after com-
mitting the horrible act, had succeeded in destroying him-
self. The particulars, which are obtained from Inspector
Randal, of the L division of police, are as follows :—Tho
murderer, whose name is William Heeley, a shoemaker,
cohabited with his victim, the wife of Thomas Wether-
ley, who obtained his living by exhibiting a seal about
the streets in a wheelbarrow, passing it off as a sea-dog.
;Nary Weatherley left her husband and lived for a short
time with her murderer, but upon the husband entreating
her return and promising forgiveness, she put herself,
penitent, under the protection of her lawful guardian.
William Heeley upon learning her return became mad-
dened with jealousy_and in the absence of her
husband went to the house, No. 4, Caroline-buildings,
and after fruitlessly attempting to persuade his victim to
resume her disgraceful life with him, he pulled from
his pocket a carving knife and cut her throat. The
poor creature, with the frightful gash bleeding, rushed
from the house, and, upon reaching the flag-stone before
that of No. 14, fell down and expired. The neighbour-
hood being alarmed, attempts were made to secure the
murderer, who stood at the door brandishing the knife,
and vowing instant destruction to the first who ap-
proached to arrest him. The few persons then collected
were horror-struck, and, from want of physical courage
and self-possession, they permitted the murderer to with-
draw within the house, and, upon the arrival of the police,
who broke open the door, the man was found with his head
nearly severed from the body.
The neighbourhood is of a low description, there is
no thoroughfare to the scene of this awful tragedy, and it
may be deemed curious that is within a few hundred yards
of the residence of the attempted regicide Oxford. The
inquest, it is expected, will take place to-morrow.

" The mania for speculation seems to be gaining ground
in this island. We have Joint Stock Companies, formed
for Banking purposes, and for the culture of silk ; Joint
Stock Companies for assurance from fire, and supplying
the city of Ligunena with water.
'We have the city mills, which supply the town with
bread at sd. currency or 31. sterling per lb.
An engagement with three slavers took place off the
coast of Cuba in February last. In a letter from the
Island of Grand Caymana, it was stated that three or four
slavers, bound to Cuba, were expected in March to
pass through a particular strait, known only to pilots of
Cuba. This information was immediately communicated
to the Commodore, who, within a few hours, promptly
despatched two ships of war to cruise under a Caymanian
pilot, in the strait referred to. One of these vessels, after
cruizing during the month of March, returned to Port
Bengal in the beginning of April, the other about a fort-
right after fell in with three other expected slavers,
and, from a letter dated Grand Caymana, the 30th of
May, it appeared that the commander of the British
cruiser attempted to board them. The slavers fired into
and shattered the men-of-war boats. It is not stated
whether any lives were lost; but the bold attack of the
slavers proved successfnl to them, for they all escard,
and no doubt with flying colours, as having overmatched Bri-
tish interference, carryiug their cargo of living mer.
ebandize into the stronghold of West Indian slavery—
Cuba. The prospects, as regards the crop, are decidedly
gloomy, and the chances aro that the crops will fall consi-
derably short of the last.

We have received Barbadoes papers to the 7th of June.
We should think the crop of sugar of this unfortunate
year is now nearly shipped. There have been sent away
to the present period to England, Ireland, and Scotland,
only 9,322 hogsheads. To the same period last year the
merchants shipped nearly 17,000 hogsheads. There is
hal,: doubt that the colonies generally will fall very short
in theirsugar crop.
The steamer has brought files of papers from Demerara,
Tobago, Trinidad, Granada, and St. Vincent.
In Trinidad great improvements in public matters are
expected to result from the energy and ability of the new
Lieutenant Governor, Sir Henry M'Leod, who, in his ad-
dress to the Council, has spoken out very plainly of the
reforms be sees necessary.
Rio Janeiro Papers to the 16th May. Exchange 30,

From Sydney papers received to the 21st March, it ap-
peals that a destructive fire took place in Sydney; the whole
pile of building known as the Roy al Hotel and old Theatre
was in flarrea, and before daylight the whole mass was in
ruins ; the destruction of property must have been very
great. The Hobart Town Courier of the 6th March, state
that little or no alteration has taken place in the price of
grain.

A Lisbon mail has arrived, brought by the Iberia
steamer. The intelligence she brings is not of much im
portance. It appears that Marshal Saldanha returned
there unexpectedly from England, owing to his riot being
able to settle the question with which he was charged.
His arrival has caused some sensation, and report says it
will be the carse of some important changes in the Mi-
nistry ; but a postscript to a letter, dated on the afternoon,
says that every thing is likely to be made up, as the Go-
vernment found they had made a mistake, and that the
proper description of bills to pay the British claims bear-
ing interest was to be sent to London, and that the
change in the Ministry, it is said, will be put off for the
present.

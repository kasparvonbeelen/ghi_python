M. DE BERANGER.

The following is the text of the sentence on him
End his publishers :
A Whereas in the song•entitled The Guardian
,ft ge bl,
and especially in the eighth couplet of it,
e author thas ridiculed one of the sacraments of the
'ei'gion of the state, and- also that religion itself;
41(1 whereas he has by so doing rendeted himself
114tY of the offence defined in the first article of the
h 4" of the 25th of March;- 1822; and whereas in
1e ninth couplet of the same song, by throwing
Nbts upon the doctrine of rewards and punish-
-41 ents in another life,he has committed the offence
_
insulting public and religious morals •
t, ``Whereas, in the song entitled derontocincy,'
rle author, by presenting the total ruin of France
the
- very distrust, and as the inevitable result of
'e Government which is now established among
~glihas excited the nation to hatred and contempt of
"he Government of the King ;
Whereas the song of The Consecration of
Charley the 'Simple" is not susceptible of any double
erpretation, but evidently contains an insult
Slitinst the person of the King ;, , •
thl` Whereas Beranger has acknowledged himself
e author of the aforesaid songs, and has admitted
ti 44 he sold them to Baudouin for the purposes of
- -
5. Whereas Baudouin has acknowledged that he
ilsed them to .tie printed, and that he has sold
t'iktly the whole of the impression ; and whereas he
tNoot plead the honesty ofdlis intention, or his igno-
4hce of their contents, since he bought such songs
O 4 pleased from those which Beranger presented
him;
1," Whereas, with respect to Lecluse, Breaute,
and Truchy, it is riot sufficiently made out
4tihey acted knowingly.
tok The Court condemns Pierre Jean de Beranger
rNliine months' ,imprisonment, and a fine of 10,000
'leg. (Strong emotion among the audience.)
The PRESIDENT—Officers, command silence.--
thittemns Alexander Baudouin to six months!
nment, and to a fine of 500 francs; dismisses
'll,le indictment against Fain, Lecluse, Breaute, and
pleb), ; declares-the sei2ure good, and condemns
,:rzuser and Baudouin to pay the costs of the pro-
%ton."

We have just seen the skeleton remains -of
Cbuny, the Elephant, the late pride and. glory of
I'tgr 'Change. It is really a mast stupendous exhibition,
R 4 44e that will richly repay the trouble of a visit.—
(11n the present specimen, we should judge that the living
i:".(14), must have been as fine an animal as Cobhett—who,

4riling
to Mr. O'Connell, is the finest and most unique
Ellie kind in England.
6 We have just seen a work, entitled " A Prac-
„,
tvii!A View of the
.State of Slavery in the West Indies,"
we would particularly recommend to those inte-
tsd in the circumstances of the question, for the very
iPerate and judiclous manner in which it is canvassed.
t'e writer, Mr. Alexander Barclay, states that he has
!11 fur one-and-twenty years resident in Jamaica, which,
ued as his experience is by the advantages of dispassionate
thtnning, is sufficient to stamp him as a high authority on
subject of slavery. Accordingly his work, we are glad
bud, has reached-a third edition.

We hear that the Russian Admiral regards
iuspiciutts eye the arrival of our naval reinforcement+,

in her worst characters, while in her best she makes a

generous enthusiasm, and that perfect abandonment

nesS and conciliate his good-will, which man may
talk about, but which woman only can feel. That

the character was not strictly 'according to Shak-
speare is, perhaps, rather in its favour, since if -it
were, it would outrage our notions of decorum,
which are rather tool/him and strait-laced (though
quite sufficiently relaxed upon occasions, notwith-
standing our favourite boast of English morality,)
for the looser atmosphere of Ansonia. In a word,
Miss Fitatmis's Juliet is the best we have seen—
with the exception of Miss F. H. KELLY, whir--h it
nearly equals—since the days of Miss O'NEIL. Mr.
COOPER'S Romeo, which reaches a depth ofabsurdity
that imagination itself can scarcely fathom, was unique
of its kind. This singularly gifted gentleman swaggered
across the stage with the clumsy tread of a ticket
porter from the India House, and made love like a coal-
heaver. Not one spark of delicacy—of good taste
—of youthful adventure—scarcely even of continon
sense—graced this superlatively absurd performance;
it was•dreary, lifeless, and monotonous, and quick-
ened every now and then into a sort of heav'y lum-
bering passion, like the waters of a Dutch canal,
when stirred into lazy action by the wind. We
realty wonder how Juliet could look and love when
such a freezing " sweetheart" stood beside her !
But Mr. COOPER has no doubt played Romeo for the
last time.

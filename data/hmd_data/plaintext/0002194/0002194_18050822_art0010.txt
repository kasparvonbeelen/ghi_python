It is said, that the Confederated Myers had reed,
in ease all attempts to effe& a Peace. with 1 Cdr-
sican Usurper, and secure the independence of other
States, should fail, to send Ambassadors to the right-
ful Monarch of France, and urge him to make an al)_
peal to the honour, the duty, the affeetion, and the
pride and common sense of his subjeels, on the dis-
grace, oppression, and misery to which they are re-
duced by a Foreign Despot. Such a measure had
been recommended long ago, but it would, perhaps,
have more effeet at present, as the unhappy people
of France have drained the revolutionary cup to the
very dregs, and find the bitter draught is composed
of nothing but humiliation, despotism, and the most
abje& slavery, If this appeal should really be made
before any offensive operations commence against the
Corsican Usurper, it may shake him on his Throne,
and tend more to the deliverance of Europe than any
adual hostility against France. Nay, it may obviate
the necessity of all military operations but such as
may rescue France from its present deplorable state of
bondage and despair, groaning, as it does, under the
severest police ever known in any country, by order
or auspicious Upstart, who insults all other Powers,
and seems ambitious to extend his tyranny over the
whole civilized world.

It Is to be hoped that if any of the Continental
Powers ' should at last be roused into aetive ex-
ertion. against the Corsican Despot, they -will them-
selves also issue such a Manifesto as will be an appeal
to the French Nation against the ambition, injustice,
and aggressions of their Foreign Oppressor. It is
full time to pull this man from the height which he
has gained by his crimes as much as by any merits
that may belong to his chargter. The condition of
the French themselves, under a Govermnent that
hardly leaves them even the privilege of thinking,
and that certainly forbids them to-utter their thoughts,
is alone sufficient to induce them to shake off his
usurpation i but when they find that his insolence
to other Powers, and, his encroachments upon their
territories, and all his numerous oats of violence and
ambition, is likely to involve them in new wars
and grievous conscriptions, they will surely assert
their rights, and -rid themselves of such a detest-
able Tyrant.

Yesterday we received New-York PaPoo to the
20th► ult. which however bring no intelligence of
importance. _ _ .

On Monday the DUKE of Yoitx attended at his
Office in the Horse Guards, and transacted business
for the first time since his return from Weymouth.
His Royal Highness was constant in his attendance
on Tuesday and yesterday, giving diredions for the
arrangements that are now making in the Army.
Yesterday the Duke of CLARENCE completed hic
fortieth year.,

Private advices from India were yestertlarzeceiv.
ed.--They state that Peace has been coicluded with
the Rajah of Bnutereona, on terms alike honour-
able to the RA:JAH and creditable to the British, It
' is added, that Houtaa had manifested afresh dispo,
sition to treat for Peace, and that the general tran-
ipfillity of India was shortly expe&ed to be restored. •
A spirit of dissention and revolt, we learn, still
continues to pervade several of the Provinces itrhei
vicinity of Canton, and several skirmishes had
place between the Insurgents and the Imperial
ArMy with alternate success, and it was supposed
it would require all the force and energy of the Em-
pire to restore tranquillity to the State.
'Letters from the Ghlph .of Persia mention, that
the Imaum.of MuscAT was lately killed in an en-
gagement between a part of his Fleet and the in-
habiterits of theripposite shore, who have icing been
on terms Of hostility, the latter being the disciples
of the Wahabee, and. the former a True Believer.
An article )n a. Cork Paper, which we received yes-
terday, Communicates the fallowing important Intel-
lifeece. It states, " that at this moment the Spanish
/v onarChy shakes to its foundation. The series of cir-
ciitnatinces Which immediately rotisedall those symp-
toinalitaieatiVe of the approaching decadence of this
ancient Monarchy we. cannot now develope for se
veral'reasons---hut we can aver, that the utmost-con-
sternation prevails in the palace Of Madrid, as well as
in the Cabinet and CoUncila of the State. The env.'
:gance and tyranny of the PRINCE olPEace has rolistar:
the indignation of the higher orders, as well is oei6me
of, the most ancient Public .Institutionsacknowledged
by the Laws of Spain. He has had the temerity to
interfere with the public justice of the country; by'
prevailing upon the King to suspend the furnaions of,
the Supreme Council gf. Castile, that bad confirmed
an appeal. from a Provincial Tribunal, •adverse in its
etreas to one of his. favourites,' who was a party in
the Cause. The Council haveaddressed the King in
terms becoming the at Spanitth char4ter-ssthey
have,admo.iiAled him of the consequences of such
an untoward mediation; they have reminded him in
bold and manly language, of the dependency of his
Predecessors upon the laws of Spain, and upon the
determination of the Supreme Council Of Castile in
former times ; and they; have suggested the temerity
of putting a daring favouritesibove the laws, and in-
timated the probable consequence in times so espe-
cially, marked by such vicissitudes in human autho-
rity." The Court is in. (tismay,", says our Corre-
spondent---" but stithli mid distrustfule—their men-
sums arts obstinate in some respects, and wavering in
ethers. The PRINCE of PEACR breathes vengeance;_
and the Supreme Council. of Castile v:/ws resistances
and seems to be the popular -party 'llse ProVinees
aye in disorder, and the larp cities turbulent. 'Be-
a Na v ASTI; has offered the. King a large army to crush
the spirit of rebellion, as tt is called.; sad if the im-
potency of the Coart'accept the offer--Spain wilt be
engulphed lit his obvious project of a.lt.ertding the

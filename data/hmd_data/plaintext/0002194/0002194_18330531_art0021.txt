WHITES AND BLACKS, AND WWI-
. VERSAL SUFFRAGE.
The following extracts from a work now in
the press, entitled " Sketches of Canada and
the United States," by Mr. Mackenzie, a long
resident in Canada, will be found to contain
more than one piece of news.
" EQUALITY ; ox,
.WHITCS AND BLACKS.
"The citizens of Philadelphia live in great comfort ; you
meet with very few people indeed who are not in e,sy cir-
cumstancea, and that class who live in wealth anti -filo-
ence is very numerous. I have seen several black
gentlemen riding in their carriages, some of them much
respected and very respecter le. Coloured people are in
great abundance here, and there is no slavery, nor the
least appearance of it. Yesterday forenoon, when on my
way to the post-office, I saw a lady right ahead, tall and
Etactaful in her form and movements, with a grand Leghorn
bonnet, fashionable summer dress, &c. I quickened
my pace a little, and beheld a human face of the purest
ebony ; black, black as the ace of spades! They speak
of t quality in this country, but it is in Uoper Canada
that it can be seen in all its glory. There is a man of
colour, a barber and hair dresser in our town of York.
named Boller; he is married to a coloured woman, and
th-y are respectable, well-behaved people in their line,
and punctual in their dealings ; they have, of course, a
black family : and (hear it, ye slave-trading equaLrights-
and.independence people !) they keep white men and
women servants from Europe to wait upon them and their
black children. This is turning the tables upon the
Southerona, and fairly balancing accounts with the ebony-
hearted slave-holders.
" There are certainly several very essential degrees of
liberty to which the Americans have not att dned, hut
which either have been taken, or are about to be, in our I
c,tuntry.
" When my friend Colonel Baby, of Sandwich, con-
tested the county of Kent with Messrs. Lyttle and Wil-
kinson, no less than thirty-five ladies came forward to the
hustings and gave th-ir votes,—maids and widows —one
of them gave Wilkinson a plumper. This was almost
equal to a declaration in form. Only one married lady
voted. But in Lower Canada there have been numerous
instances of women exercising the freehold right of vatting
in person for a favourite candidate Sometimes the wife
vote= on one freehold and the husband on another.
" There was a contested election at Montreal, in May,
1831, which lasted about a month : during its continu-
ance two hundred and twenty five women came forward
to vote. One of the candidates, Dr. Tracy, was an
Itiahman, and for him ninety-five ladies recorded their
votes. The other gentleman was Mr. Stanley Bagg, a
citizen of the United States, naturalized in Canada. For
him there were one hundred and four female voters. The
other twenty-six did not vote. Several ladies voted one
way, and, it is said, their husbands took the other side.
On- married lady voted in her own right. Her husband
was found to hive no vote. The Irishman won the day,
but by a very small majority. The Quebec Act, under
which the ladies vote, was passed in the British Parlia
went forty years ago.
" It is in my recollection that when Canning was
standing for Liverpool, he told the ladies in a jncular way,
that if ever be advocated the doctrine of universal suffrage,
he would not fail to include them. What is it that may
not become fashionable?
" I had almost forgotten to state, for the information
of Miaa —, and all others of the sex whom it may
concern, that the Philadelphia ladies have spright'y eyes,
regular (and not seldom handsome) features, hut that the
charming red and white of Connecticut and Boston, Aber-
deenshire, or Galway, is rather a rare ingredient south of
the Delaware."

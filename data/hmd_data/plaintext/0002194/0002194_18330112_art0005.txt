MARKET INTELLIGENCE.

LONDON MARKETS.
(From the " London New Price Current" of yesterday.)
SUGAR.—The demand for Muscovades continues very
limited. The total purchases for the week are estimated
at only 2,300 hhds. and trs., and the prices are again 6d.
lower. There is more disposition to do business in Sugars
this afternoon ; the Market has a firmer appearance. The
Habadoes at public s de, 141 hhds., sold at full prices.
There is rather more firmness in the Refined trade, owing
to the proposed reduction on the bounty in France, and
the reports of the Hamburg Market being more favour-
able. There is still a great dulness in the Refined Market
this afternoon, notwithstanding there are some inquiries
for low Lumps, and in which a few sales have been ef-
fected at the quoted prices, and also in Crashed entith•d to
the double refined bounty, several small parcels of which
have been sold at the quotations; in the Grocery descrip-
tions there is very little doing. The stock of Refined
Goods of every descriprion is at present very small.
EAST INDIA SUGAR.—There are no transactions in
Bengal Sugar, on account of the approaching East India
House sale. The demand for Siam and the other East
India descriptions has sut:sided.
MAURITIUS SUGAR.—Previous to this day's sale 7,696
bus Mauritius had been brought forward to public sale ;
the whole went off heavily at a reduction of one shilling
per Mt.
FOREIGN SUGAR.—There were no sales of Foreign
Sugar by private contract. At public sale this week,
1,129 boxes washed Havannah were brought forward—
low to mid. white sold Is. lower, 245. 6(1. a 275. 6d. ;
the inferior qualities sold higher in proportion than the
finer. Forty hhds. 25 barrels Para Muscovades, low
brown to good yellow greyish, 20s. a 225., all bought in,
but afterwards disposed of rather under the withdrawing
prices ; very low quality in barrels 18s. At the public

duction we have stated. The Market is still heavy at
48s. 6d. a 565.

COFFEE.-The public sale of above 2,000 bags Sumatra
went off with more spirit than had been anticipated ; the
late prices were maintained, ordinary to good ordinary
49v. 6d. a 525. 6d.; a parcel of ordinary Havannah has
been t iken at 525. The ordinal y descriptions of Jamaica
are lower and very heavy; the good qualties fully support
the late prices. Berbice &flee is without alteration. This
day's public sales consisted of 109 casks 172 bags Berbice,
which went off heavily about former prices, and about
one-half sold ; very ordinary Sumatra 465. 6d. a 475. ;
nine bales Mocha; the whole affording no criterion of the
state of the Market.

RUM, BRANDY, AND HOLLANDS.-The Rum Market
is little varied ; the purchases of the lower descriptions of
Jamaica have been rather extensive, Jamaica 15 and 16
over at 2s. 3d. a 2s. 4d., and common quality, Demerara

VIENNA, DEC. 27.—A pamphlet printed
elsewhere, " On Reform in Hungary," was for a short
time spoken of here. We pity the ill-informed if they can
for a moment be induced by such misrepresentations to
believe that injustice is in any way done to Hungary.
Ilow willingly would the EMPEROR. remedy the most
crying abuses, and the arbitrary abuses of the Magnates,
or introduce a more humane system with respect to the
slavery of the peasantry (for even vassalage is too mild a
term for this state of things), but his hands are tied. The
Chambers of the Magnates and of the free cities vie with
each other in the strict assertion of their privileges. No-
thing can be more absurd than the complaint of high
duties on merchandise entering the hereditary states.
The Hungarians have no land-tax, nor any direct taxes
whatever. What can be ree.ne .eaeeaeble thaa that tbrir
productions should pay a higher duty, to make up in some
measure the difference between Hungary and the other
parts of the monarchy, where land-tax and other taxes
are so heavy? The concession of a national army, to be
commanded by Hungarian officers only, would be highly
dangerous in these times. At present the promotion of
the officers goes through all the divisions of the Austrian
army, without any distinction of provinces; but the Hun-
garian regiments themselves are unmixed—all, to the
lowest rank, are national Hungarians. There is at Vi-
enna a distinct Hungarian noble guard, and a separate
Chancery, at which the Chancellor is always a Hun-
garian. How many Hungarian Generals and Statesmen
of the highest reputation 7... e there in the empire?
GEOLOGICAL COURSE OF CHOLERA.—M.
BOUBEE has made some researches into the geology of the
countries through which the cholera has passed, from
which lie remarks, that this epidemic has spread most
speedily, and with its greatest intensity, through those
districts where the tertiary and alluvial earths are most
extensive, whilst it appears to have been propagated with
great difficulty, to have lost its intensity, and even to have
been extinguished in those parts where the older and par-
ticularly the primordial formations predominate. This
coincidence of the course of the cholera with particular
geological districts, agrees with the observation pretty
well established, that the circumstances of humidity and
evaporatio favour the development of this disease. In
fact, the tertiary and alluvial earths have, to a remarkable
degree, the property of imbibing water, which being again
yielded by a prolonged evaporation, produces a humidity
of the atmosphere entirely dependent on the nature of the
soil. The older formations, on the contrary, compose or-
dinarily compact rocks, which being impermeable, can
neither absorb moisture nor present it to the atmosphere
by evaporation. Sometimes the old formations and vol-
canic depositions present rocks tbat are friable, or decom-
posed, in particular places, in which cases they will re-
semble the more recent ones in absorbing and affording
moisture, and this circumstance may explain some of the
exceptions to the general rule of the cholera adhering to
its progress to the modern formations.--Liverpoel
cal Gazette.

MANUFACTURE OF LACE —Some of the news
papers, of the 19th November, having made various
statements as to a conversation which took placl-
between the LORD MAYOR and Mr. Edenborough,
Milk-street, on the subject of the trade, we think if
necessary, for the information of the public, as well
as an act of justice towards Mr. Edenborough, to
give a correct version of what took place on the
subject.
Mr. Edenborough, who had been robbed of a
parcel of lace, stated that the goods stolen were of
the present value of 1501. The LORD MAYOR hav-
ing observed that the robbery was a large one, Mr.
Edenborough said that it would have been consi-
dered so ten or fifteen years ago, at which period
the same goods would have been worth 1,0001.

The LORD MAYOR asked what could have caused
so large a depreciation ?—Mr. Edenborough stated
that it arose principally from the extraordinary and
continued improvements in lace machinery, to which
steam-power was now very much applied ; a cir-
cumstance by which the price of manual labour was
greatly reduced, and many persons were thrown
out of employment who formerly could earn
from 30s. to 50s. per week—live in comfort,
and bring up their families respectably—but
were now reduced to the workhouse. In conse-
quence of these extraordinary and continued im-
provements in machinery the lace-machines used in
1817, and which would then have cost 5,0001.,
were not worth 5001. now. This statement applied
to the plain lace, or nett—i. e. before it was worked
or embroidered by females—and the reduction of
price in their wages also, during the same period,
had been 50 to 75 per cent., thereby scarcely af-
fording at the present time a subsistence to many
thousands of industrious and ingenious females,
workers of that beautiful article, who formerly could
earn from 104. to 15s. per week. The cause of the
latter depreciation, Mr. Edenborough observed, was
attributable to the very large introduction of lace
and other light fabrics from France, which inter-
fered with, and very often superseded, the use
of our own manufacture., particularly that of
British lace.

The LORD MAYOR believed that pauperism was
wofully increased by the improvements in ma-
chinery. If Government continue the ruinous sys-
tem of free trade, they ought, at least, to adopt tha
old plan of marking all goods imported. It would
greatly decrease the quantity brought in—increase
the revenue materially—protect the honest impor-
ter who paid the duty, and, in a great degree, put
a stop to smuggling, which is now carried on in all
light fabrics to an enormous extent.

In the mean time a warrant for assault against
Askworth, obtained by Mr. Pendry, the husband of
the last defendant, was called on for hearing.
The defendant Askworth, who is an elderly man
of very diminutive stature, displaying prodigious
quantity of shirt collar, tripped into the office with
a janty air to answer the charge. Mr. Pendry
stated, that on Twelfth-night he went to Mrs. Mar-
shall's house, and on seeing Askworth sitting in
the parlour, he made an observation to the effect
that he should like to give that little rascal a horse-
whipping.
At this stage of the charge Askworth burst out
affectedly into a laugh.
Mr. CONANT—Now, really, Sir, your conduct is
,titolerable. This is neither time nor place for you
to indulge in such levity, therefore I shall direct an
officer to place you at the bar.
The defendant, when put to the bar, appeared
rather crest-fallen, and made a suitable apology, at-
tributing his laughter to the trivial nature of the
charge against him.
Mr. CONANT—WeII, Sir, but have you heard of
the charge against you respecting this lady's sister,
whom, it is said, you have decoyed from her situa-
tion for base purposes?
Dear me, said the defendant, flourishing a white
cambric handkerchief, the charge is totally prepos-
terous, there is not an iota of shadow for its founda-
tion. It would be beneath my character to rebut it.
Mrs. Pendry here stood up and reminded him of an
attack made by his wife on Christmas-day, when
she met him and her sister walking together.
As the assault was of a negative character, the
Magistrate:imposed a fine of Is. and costs only.
Schofield, having returned, said he had been un-
able to see the sister, as she had locked herself in
Miss Bagley's room, probably anticipating the nature
of his visit.
Mr. CONANT said he feared he could not render
Mrs. Pendry any assistance, for even if he induced
her sister to come forward, he doubted, from her
conduct on this occasion, whether advice would have
effect upon her. The Worthy Magistrate then
cautioned Mrs. Marshall, now she was fully ac-
quainted with the circumstances of the case, not to
lend herself to proceedings which tended to the ruin
of the girl; and then, addressing Miss Bagley, re-
marked, that her conduct throughout the whole
transaction was of such a disgraceful character that
he felt bound to dismiss the warrant against Mrs.
Pendry.—The parties then quitted the office.

AGRICULTURAL DISTRESS.

Lord C H ANDO S gave notice that on the ith of
July he should move a resolution relative to the pre-
sent state of agricultural distress.

FINANCE. AND SAVINGS' BANKS.

Mr. A. BARING wished to be informed by the
noble lord at what time he intended to bring forward
his statement on the finances of the country. He
%could take :this opportunity of putting another ques-
tion to the noble lord. Some time'back he asked the
noble lord whether it was true, as reported, that any
part of the stock standing in the name of Savings'
Banks was to be sold. The noble lord told him not.
Be admitted that the security of Savings' Banks
'would not thereby be diminished. He now asked the
noble lord whether he abided by his former answer?
Toe prevailing opinion now was that it must be sold,
and that was now employed in paying off the Four
per Cents. He asked the noble lord whether it was
so or not ?

Lord ALTHORP said he did not recollect having
tnld his hon. friend that no part of that stock was to be
sold. What he stated upon the occasion alluded to,
in answer to the question of his hon. 'friend, was, that
it was not to be sold for the purpose of being applied
to the payment of West India proprietors under the
bill for abolishing slavery. Soine sales in this stock
for (as we tuiderstood) the other purposes mentioned
by the hon. gentleman did take place, bur not to a
large amount. With respect to the financial state-
meet, he should be prepared to bring it forward at an
early day after the close of the present quarter.
Mr. BARING gave notice that he should take a
future opportunity of moving for a return of the
amount of Savings' Banks' Stock sold under the au-
thority of the Treasury.
Mr: HUME asked at what time the return of plu-
ralities, for which he moved on the Bth of May, would
be ready ?
Lord ALTHORP did not know, but would make
inriry.

COVNT-GARDEN THEATRE.

Sheridan Knowles's new play. entitled Women's Wit ; or.lhe Arts of
Love, was brought out at this theatre last night. The house was crowded ;
the applause fervent; and the play throughout as successful as honest
James could possibly desire. The plot is something to the following
effect :—Lord Athunree, a titled profligate, who, in the expressive dic-
tion of the author, " Owns no curb of honour," entertains base designs
on the virtue of Hero, the fair, high-spirited, and romantic niece of
Sir William Sutton. A gallant young knight, Sir Valentine de Grey,
is deeply enamoured with the lady, but he has seen her waltz with the
libertine Lord ; he reads the lady a lecture on the subject, and she to be
revenged has recourse to woman's wit; she assumes the garb of a
Ouakeress, and by the assistance of Obadiah, her servant, obtains
interview with her lover at the family country-seat in Greenwich ;
;it ought to have been mentioned, that the time of the drama appears
to be laid somewhere about the gay and voluptuous period of Charles
the Second.) Obadiah has previously given Sir Valentine to under-
stand that Hero has a sister so much alike, that but for her subdued
manner and simple attire she might be taken for the same person.
The parties meet, and the young gallant is smitten by the unaffected
grace and charms of Ruth, who in turn lectures hint severely on
the vanities of his high sounding name and title; so touch so that
he consents if she will but love him, to lay aside his gay and flaunting
dress, and be called plain Peter. Meanwhile Walsingham, a man of sen-
timent, and Eustace, a gentle youth, ale brought forward; the former
has deeply loved a lady, who in the drama is supposed to have fallen a
foul victim to the snares of the miscreant Lord Athunree: Eustace,
though in male attire, bears such a striking resemblance to the lost love
of Walsingham, that the latter resolves to cherish him as a brother. As
the action of the play proceeds, they meet Lord Athunree, whom
Eustace denounces as a murderer; a hostile meeting is appointed for
the following clay; Lord Athunree has other business on hand ; he de-
termines at ail hazards to put himself in possession of Hero, for
which purpose he hires one Lewson, a miserable creature, to do his
work. They concoct a scheme—Lewson is to break into the house
occupied by Hero, at Greenwich, and Athunree is to make his
appearance, apparently to succour the lady, but in truth to carry
her off. This design, however, is frustrated partly by certain compunc-
tious visitings felt by the ruffian Lewson, but chiefly by the miscar-
riage of a note in which is written his instructions. The plot is thu,
discovered, and a warrant is issued for the apprehension of Lord
Athunree, who is proved guilty, and quits the scene in merited dis-
grace. Finally, Eustace turns out to be none other than the former
eve of Walsingham, and the long lost sister of Hero ; she (Hero), too,
raving abandoned the guise of the fair Quakeress, meets Sir Valentine
de Grey in her own character. A mutual explanation takes place,
and they arc left in happy posses ion of cacti other.

It will be seen from the above slight analysis of the plot, that it is
something of a complex character—in fact, has a little Irish confusioi:
in it; still, it is interesting.- deeply interesting, and the characters,
which arc numerous, have all that "mark and likelihood" with which
Knowles is so successful in investing his dramatis person v. The great
charm of the play is, indeed, its developement of character—which the
author seems co understand thoroughly. Hero is an exquisite creation,
abounding in touches of sentiment truly Shakesperian ; and as full-
informed with life and animation as a young lady on the eve of her first
ball. What can be more true:to nature than her reflections upon love
We subjoin this exquisite passage, which Charles Lamb would have boen
in extacics with, and which is worthy of Beaumont and Fletcher.
HERO—She did ! You know not when
A woman gives away her heart. At times
She knows it not herself. Insensibly
It goes from her! She thinks she hall it still—
If she reflects—while smoothly runs the course
Of wooing ; but if happy conies a cheek:—
An irrecoverable—final one—
Aghast, forlorn—she stands, to find it lost,
A;,l with it ail the world."

The part of Hero—a difficult one—was admirably played by Miss
Faucitt with a freshness—a vivacity—and a thorough insight into the
idiosyncracy of the character not often displayed on our modern
stage. It is paying this promising young lady no unmerited
compliment when we say that her consummate acting—more particularly
as the Quakeress—was one of the main causes of the success of the play.
Macready had little to do, but what little he had, he turned to admirable
account, and gave an emphasis and significance to sentiments and images
which a less accomplished actor and well educated gentleman would have
passed wholly unnoticed. Mr. Harley's mock-quaker was laughable
and amusing, and laughter, we presume was the sole aim he had in
view. Miss Taylor, as Helen Mowbray, performed with her usual tact
and spirit ; and Mr. Warde, as Lord Athunree, made a very exemplary
villain. The poetry of the play is cordial and natural throughout, and
occasionally highly impassione.l Indeed the author, like Burke, seems
to grow more isnaginativeas he grows older; and: if he" progresses" at the
same rate, we shall not despair of seeing him cor ae close to Shakspeare by
the time he has reached his eightieth birth-day.. We wish, however, he
would not so studiously affect the Elizabethan dialect; but write, like
Sergeant Talfourd, in the vernacular of his day. Asa specimen of his
style, we quote the following passages, the first of which strikes us as
being perfect of its kind. Observe how exquisitely selected is the
epithet " golden :"
Hxao.—Whether mine eye with a new spirit sees,
Or stature is grown lovelier, I know not;
But ne'er, methinks, was sunset half so sweet!
He's down, and yet his glory still appears,
Live to the memory of a well.spent
That's golden to the last, and when 'tis. oer,
Shines in the witnesses it leaves behind.
LEWSON (Entering in disorder.)
" I cannot do't I Heaven's on the watch against it!
"Ds said it guards the good, and if it does,
Its spirits sure are here—they are!—or why
This fearful awe come over me ? I feel
As eyes were on me, that I cannot see--
Above me lips that speak but are unheard—
And hands that have a thousand thou sand times
The power of flesh and blood, yet lack the bulk .
Of air Heaven will not have it be—it sets
Before mine eyes the fruit of what I've done—
To warn me back from what I've come to do.
That hapless maiden owes her injured name
To me ! I was the instrument to ruin her,
To fix on her the wanton's brand, that ne'er
In thought it seems did know the wanton's stain.
To Oamn in this world, what i' the next is blest:
Oh heavy sin—Go, sin no more! How's this?
Go, sin no snore! So said the book to me.
Then Heavers doth care for sinners, it should seem!
A blessed book ! I'll go and sin no more!
The chime! It lacks a quarter of an hour,
The very clock doth watch me. Was't the hour,
The'y'd have me in their fearful toils again !
Away I away ! speed feet, while ye are free,
Softly and swift—the minutes fly ! away !"

Lord ATHUTREE.—Her waist was in my custody;
Her white arm hanging from my shoulder, where
Her hand did freely couch. " Your game goes well !"
I whisper'd her ; " Play boldly, and 'tis yours ,
The measure this to set the outline off!
Give sway thy rich figure! Abandon thee
To the spirit of the dance! Let it possess thee!
Float thee as air were footing for thee ! stud
Thy cheeks with smiles of fire, and give thine eye
The lightning's dazzling play! fix them on mine,
That each do feed the other's, like to tongues
With converse waking converse!"
Thou should'st have seen the issue on't—
While, like a pupil at a task he loves,
Whose aptitude with eager will outstrips
His master's bidding, she was twenty times
The thing I wish'd her! How she rose and sank
With springy instep, while her yielding waist—
Well as her waving neck, her beauteous head—
Did show her fair and falling shoulders off!
A world she look'd and moved of passionate
Quick sense—of loveliness and joyousness—
And, Ibe sure, did show its reigning lord!
Nor with the measure did dominion cease;
But when her drooping lids, relaxed steps,
Disparted lips, and colour vanishing,
Gave suite she must give o'er—her languid :form,
Close girdled by my arm—her hand in mine„
Her cheek for pillow on bay shoulder laid,
I led her to a couch, where courtesy
Of course admitted tendancc !

FELTON.—Are you not fond of dancing,, then ?
SIR VALENTINE.—I am.
Innocent pastime taken innocently
In holiest mood! But there are natures, Sir,
That should eschew it—which 'tie pernicious to—
As wine, that's mirth to some, to some is i nadness !
I find no fault with dancing! 'Tie an act;
Sets beauty ofF, proportion, grace; when these
Are too set offby modesty. For men,
And women more especially, of the vein
That's opposite, I'd have them lookers oin- -
For their own sakes first—next for the saki of these;
Who what they'd blush to do, do grieve to see
Enacted.

SIR VALENTINE—She danced with light ness more
Than lightest measure warranted. Nothii
A modest woman does—say that it touches.
The utmost verge of license—but that ci nuture,
Of better proof than zone of adamant,
Its holy and offence_repelling tires
Doth wave around her, that the libertine;
Unwon by honour, yet is tam'd by awe !
She (tailed to gladden eyes whose burnin g gla:ices
Turn thoughts of honest men on dashin g swords,
On flame at stains washed out alone by Wood !
The empire of her beauty giving prey
To parasites, who love for their own end
And by their homage shame !

llEno What a fate w; is her's!
Of all I valued, she the being was
I least could measure worth with. Of el I grace,
The pattern was she—person, features, xr dud,
Heart, everything, as nature had assay 'd
To frame a work which none might find, a flaw in !
And yet 'tis said, she fell—and if she di
Let none be sure they'll stand! She c' yaldn't fall!
There's,such a thing as purity on earth. ,
And if she fell, there could be no such t! sing!
She didn't fall !—no! no !---I knew her„ or
I never knew myself! Virtue with h( a •
Was not a lesson we must con before
'Tis learn'd by heart; it was a portion so f her,
Much as her stature, feature, limb, or sh ape,
Which, saving Nature's, hand did never give.
She has been outrag'd, slandered—aught I—but lost !
She could not fall—she did not—could n of fall !
a

WALSINGIIAM.-011, she did stand aka is ! To truest heart.
The sight of her was wonderful estranges vent,
Weaning them for a time from things, Is )we'er
Clung dotingly to before—that mitre: ;se s
Have sadden'd to see eyes that blaz'd m them
Ere they were turn'd away, turn back . again
Listless and icy cold! Riches and rat
Bestudded o'er and gilded, have look' blank
To see themselves outshone without a gem !
Nay, very hostesses, whose only care
Was to behold their costly huswirry
Approv'd, have been discomfited to F
Their tables crow n'd as ne'er they v (ere b eforef
And she the only garnish of the be lard!

At the close of the play Mr. Knowles was call ed for by the audience,
and received with a burst of applause as. v.ordial as his own fine genius.

NEGRO EMANCIPATION.

MEETING OF- DELEGA TES.
(THIS DAY.)

The Delegate-A met again this morning at eleven o'clock. at Brown's
Hotel, New Palace-yard. The attendance was very full, there being
present nearly all the Members of the Delegation now in London. Sir
George Strickland and Sir B. :Wilmot entered the room before the Chair
was takes, and were greeted with much applause. Mr. C. Lushington
was similarly received. Mr. Blair was unanimously voted to the Chair.
Mr. WiLsoN moved that a Committee or six persons be appointed to
confer with the Parliamentary friends of this sacred cause, as to the
course which should be taken in the present critical state of aft-Mrs.
Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Baines, and Mr. B. L. Bulwer, Members of Par-
liamod, came into the rnom whilst Mr. Wilson was speaking, and were
rec iced with great applause.

The Rev. Air. SPENCEIt was opi)used to any secret conference. He
thought that the course which the delegation meant to adopt should be
stated openly.

Afler some remarks to the same effect from Mr. Scobel and (-Aber gen.

Cemen,

Mr. Si'uior and. Mr. WiLSON explained that the object of the ap.
pointment of a Committee was that there might be kept up a communi.

cation with their parliamentary friends, at times when the D:•legates
were not to be got together.

Mr. STUIWO wished to correct an error which had crept into the report
of their friend, The Sun.—(Applause.) It was erroneously stated in the
Paper of yesterday that the friends of emarcipatiun brought about the
division on Tuesday night. It was no such thing; the division was
brought on by their opponents.—(Hear.)
Mr. BAINES, M.P., said that he thought that the division could not
have taken place at a more favourable moment than after the excellent
speech of Mr. Bulwer.—(Applause.)
Mr. O'CONNELL said--Sir, I assure you that the division was brought

on at that moment by the anti-slavery party.—(Laughter, and cries of
no, no)—I beg pardon, I mean pro-slavery party.—(Laughter.)
made a mistake. I call them anties, because they were against us and
our holy cause.—(Cheers.) They provoktd the division—they chose
the moment—they thought it favourable; and I thank God that they
were mistaken.—(Cheers.)

Sir E. WILMOT then rose to address the meeting, and was received
with most enthusiastic cheering.- lie said that in the situation in which
he had been placed by the confidence of the Delegates, of bringing for.
ward the motion he had done in the House of Commons, he felt deeply
the responsibility of that situ at, on, turd the tdfficulty in which the ques-
tion was placed. His friends who were here, particularly Mr. Sturge,
knew very well that from the commencement he had taken to heart
the subject of the entire abolition of slavery, and nothing on earth
should prevent hint from taking every means, publicly anti privately, to
effect that object. —(Great cheering.) He agreed v 41! the Honourable
Member for Dublin, that it would not then be prtitivilt to state or detail
the answer he meant to give to-night to Lord John Russell.—(Cheers.)
He had deeply considered it i❑ all its bearings, and subject to the
assistance of the kind friends around; he had completely made
up his mind as to the answer he should give, subject, however
to the revision of his other Parliamentary friends.—(Hear.) He
felt himself, however, open at the same time to the advice, not
only of the Members of the House of Commons, but from the Dele.
gates themselves, from whom he would be nicst happy to receive any
suggestion.—(Hear.) He felt that his character was the character of
the Delegates.—(Ciieers.) He bad been grossly assailed as a person
who had brought forward the question from personal motives, and for
the purpose of gaining popularity. He denied most strenuously that
he had had any such objects in view.—(Cheers.) He had taken the
question up in his own county on time ground of the injustice and
inhumanity of slavery.—(Loud . cheers.) lu that county he
had been appointed the Chairman of a meeting on the subject,
and he had also been honoured with a similar office at a great
meeting at Exeter Hah ; but he would ask all present, if he did not
signify that it was his wish that one snore capable than himself should
have that honour?—(Cheers.) In conclusion, he wished to state that
be felt his character was the character of the delegates ; and if his cha-
racter was injured by remarks of the description to which he had ad.
verted, the character of the delegates was injured also, in having placed
their ern fidence in a person that was unworthy of them. He wished to state
this, in order that he might stand in a true and proper light before the
public. He had advocated the question to the best of his abilities,
and he could assure the Delegates that no power on earth should turn
blur to the right or the left in carrying out the great principle of the
entire abolition of slavery,—(Great cheering.)
Atter a short discussion six gentlemen were appointed a Sub-Com-
mittee, to draw up the resolutions for the General Meeting 10-morrow.
Mr. STURGIE said that if any of the other Members of Parliament
present wished to offer any advice the Delegates would i,e happy to
hear them.

Sir G. STRICKLAND thought that the appointment of the Suh-Com-
mittee, in the propriety of which he entirely concurred, almost precluded
the meeting from the impropriety of any discussion. The meeting had
conferred upon the Committee all the powers they possessed. He was
and always had been the friend of publicity, but he was the friend to it
with discretion.—(Cheers.) He• thought the Member. of Parliament
present ought not to prolong the meeting of the Committee by dis.
cussion.—(Cheers.)
Mr. WILSON proposed the hearty thanks of the meeting to their
Parliamentary friends, for their attendance, which was most enthusias-
tically received and carried.
Mr. lharn, the Chairman, trusted that they would see many of their
Parliamentary friends to-morrow at the meeting.—;Cheers.)
The Members present and the Sub-Committer then retired amid
great cheering.
R. PEAKS;, Esq.. having been called to the chair,
The Rev. Mr. SPENCER then rose to propose the resolutions v,hieh he
had given notice of yesterday :

" 1. TO steal a man and sell him is a crime in the sight of God ;---t.)
retain in bondage a man thus stolen and sold is not less a crime ;—the
receiver being as bad as the thief.

" 2. The which is a crime when one man is concerned, and for one
life, becomes infinitely more heinous when the theft and sale India,
800,000 hum,n beings, and for many generations—lapse of time, t:o far
from rendering right that which was at iginally wrong, only adding force
to the demand for justice.

" 3. That the continuance of slavery under any form gives life to the
slave trade, which natims have in vain endeavoured to put down, but
which would cease of itself when slavery is no longer tolerated.
. .

---
" 4. 'That all laws, which sanction the forcible.detention'of our fellow-
creatures, unconvicted of crime, are opposed to the )ivine will, which
requires that men should lave their neighbour as themselves, acknow-
ledge all men as brethren, children of one common father, who is no re-
specter of persons, but has made of one blood all nations of men to dwell
upon the earth.

" 5, The Acts of Parliament plainly, contrary to tli; commands of
the Supreme Being, me no more binding on the conscience than unlaw-
ful oaths or promises, to do that which God has forbidden ; the Legisla-
ture hay no more power to justify the stealiti,;, selling, or detaining
of a man, than to justify murder itself.

- -
" 6. That the a;)prcnticed negroes being detained in bondage, not
only without that command of God, which alone could sanction such bon-
dage, but in direct opposition to that command, it is not to be wondered
at that all accounts from the West Indies manifest an extensive determi.
nation on their part to adopt the system of passive resistance as the only
means of obtaining that liberty which was their -birthright, and for
which also tho people of England have paid 20,000,000/.
" 7. That having regard to the example of the Apostle Paul, who,
when detained unjustly for a short time and beaten with stripes, by his
passive resistance, compelled the magistrates to comply with his just
demands, it would be unjust in us to censure the negro, if, after patient
endurance of oppression, he asserts his rights, without violenec, and re-
fuses any longer to be treated as a malefactor or a brute

" 8. That as men we declare, that if we were this day enslaved and
placed under the unjust oppression of a taskmaster, we would refuse to
obey his orders; we would not, by timid servility, minister to his
wealth ; we would not sanction his usurpation of our rights, or forfeit
the privileges which, as men, we have a right to enjoy ; and since we
are commanded to remember them that are in bonds as bound with
them,' we consider the passive resistance which would t.e right in us,
if we were unjustly placed in bondage, cannot be wrong in those who
are now so placed."

The Rev. Mr. JOHNSTON seconded the motion, because it was con-
sidered in mail), parts that thcy were met for some political purpose.
Had such been the case it would have been impossible to have got to-
gether such a number of religious •men. ' Their object was one most
strictly moral and religious, and he took the Resolutions to be founded
upon the Bible itself, and he would consent to nothing that was con_
trary to the doctrines which he preached from the inspired volume. If
the resolutions were true, why not pass them, and lay them boldly before
the whole world.

Mr. J. W. ALEXLNDER recommended that the resolutions should not
be pressed, because it was quite possible thatlthev might do much harm to
the cause they all had so much at heart. They could not at present be
passed unanimously, and unless that were done it would do more harm
than good.

Mr. KNIGHT heartily approved of every sentiment contained in the
resolutions, but if Clay passed them new, would it not be something
like a disapproval of their former declarations. To him it appeared that
the resolutions were only an amplification of their former declarations,
with which the public were already well acquainted.
Mr. SCOBELL said, in point of form it was very inexpedient to consider
the resolutions, as the labours of the sub-Committee might render them
entirely unnecessary.
The Rev. Mr. BUNTING could assure the meeting that he agreed with
every resolution in the list, but he was aware of some facts which must
become known hi a day or wetter !;:tve hee mach hope, but they
made hint entreat Otte Speecer would withdraw them at present,
Mr. Blair, the Chairman, and the Sub-Clmin;t:ec, now roturned, and
said they had a very satisfactory meeting with their Parliamentary
friends, and that they had agreed upon the course which ought to be pur-
sued o❑ the present occasion. He was not then at liberty robe more ex.
plicit, but he mi;4iit say teat nothing would be done sacrifice: or even
compromise the great principles upon which they were acting.
Captain STEWART deprecated the resolutions—As a Christian he could
not agree with them, and if passed he would conscientiously be oleiged
to withdraw from among them.
The Rev. MI. SPENCER rose to withdrew the resolutions until ano-
ther meeting. In doing so he said the, fear of pasrive resistance on the
part of the slave was the only thing which sle,ok the determination of the
planter, and if it was recomm.:nded, he thought the planters would come
forward and say to the Ministry that they gave up the cause, and freed
them from the necessity of opposing the resolution of the House of
Commons.

Mr. STANSFIELD rose to move a vote of thanks to Charles Harvey,
Esq., solicitor, of Jamaica, for endeavouring to maintain the rights of
the negro. lie had Lean much persecuted for the endeavours he had
in,le in the glorious cause of humanity

.1. STuitut.;, Esq., had the pleasure of knlwing the gentleman named in
the res•lntiou, He was one of two solicitors, who were the only ones
in who d.ded to take up the causes of the neAroes, and he had
been touch persLcuted in consequence. He had need for their sym-
pathy, foe he bad suffered much both i❑ health and pocket.
It was then ordered that the small pamphlet on Sugar Duties be distri
Muted to-morrow at the end of the public meeting.
'1 he meeting then adjourned.

and that recourse has been had to the ordinary mode of procedure by

CRIMINAL COURT-(TUESDAY.)::

NEW COURT.

Thomas Paul, an excavator, was indicted for stealing a silver watch-
case, a pencil-case, a pocket-book, and other articles, the property of the
late Duncan Crawford, deceased. Another count charged the property
as belonging to Charles James, Lord Bishop of London.

Tinsley, an attorney, his employer, did receive the sum of 11. 3s. on the
12th of May, and a further sum of 1/. on the 16th of May, for and on
account of the said John Tinsley, and that !le afterwards did secrete,
embezzle, and steal the same.
Mr PHILLIPS stated the case for the prosecution.
Mr. Paves addressed the Jury for the pis-men
The Jury, after five minutes' consideration, returned a verdict of
acquittal, accompanied with the following expression :—" The Jury
think that not only the prisoner at the bar has been neglectful in this
case, but likewise his master, Mr. Tinsley, therefore we present that
his conduct is highly reprehensible, and likely to do great injury to
prisoners who may be brought here for trial."
The RECORDER admonished the prisoner as to his future conduct.
The prisoner declared that he was sorry for what had occurred.

comfortable domestic establishments.

SHAKSPEARE.—A new work is announced for
immediate publication, bearing the attractive title of " Shakspeare and
Hie Friends." We understand that it is an historical romance,
founded on the life of the immortal poet, and illustrating the state
of society and manners during the reign of Elizabeth. The author's
undertaking is a bold one; for to pourtray successfully the nu-
merous distinguished characters whom Shakspeare numbered among
his friends, including the munificent Earl of Southampton,
Ben Jonson, Burbage, and, indeed, almost all the master spirits of
England's Golden Age, is a task excee,:ingly hard of accomplishment;
not to speak of the difficulty of attempting faithfully to depict the " Poet
of Nature" himself. The reader, too, will naturally look for some per-
sonation of the ambiguous " Friend" to whom the sonnets were ad.
dressed. Whatever may be the character of the work however, its sub-
ject must cause its appearance to be looked fur with the greatest interest.

RADICAL MEETING ON THE CALTON HILL.
—On Monday evening a public meeting called by placards extensively
circulated throughout the vity, was held on the Calton Hill, for the pur-
pose of ln.aring Mr. Collins of Birmingham develope a plan for organiz.
ing the working.cla>ses into a union, for the purpose of obtaining Uni-
versal Suffrage, Annual Parliaments, and Vote by Ballot. Nearly two
thousand persons were assembled on the hill; but, judging by the va.
rious shows of hands which took place, about five hundred only took part
in the proceedings ; the rest were present evidently from mere curiosity.
--Scotsman.

LADIES' FEET IN CHINA.—It appears very ridi-
culous to European eyes, to see an old lady, verging into dotage, be-
lieving all eyes are turned upon her in admiration, because her feet are
no larger than those of a child five or six years of age. As she walks
through the streets, her progressive motion would incline you to believe
that she had had the misfortune to lose both her legs, and was obliged to
get about as well as she was able on a couple of wooden stumps. You
feel a great temptation to go up and offer the old lady the use of your
stick to help her along, as she seems in danger of falling every moment.
In this tottering manner they proceed, and if they wish to look behind
them, they ars obliged to stop, and then steady themselves, while they
gradually twist the whole body round as far as required. This feeble,
helpless condition of the females is very much admired by the Chinese,
who delight to see them in danger of falling. The women themselves
make it one of their principal arts of attrarr;on to endeavour to walk,
and thus shew their dependent situation. is very similar to the
affected grace of some of our European de.l:93elles, who often exagge-
rate their natural timidity in order to rouse the protecting courage of
the lords of the creation.—The Pan-qui in China.

On Friday evening last, as Win. Lloyd, Esq., of
Ludlow, was driving his children and the governess over Maryknoll, a
portion of the harness gave way, on which the horse kicked and plunged,
and ultimately set off at full speed down the hill towards Ludlow. On
arriving at Whitecliffe, Mr. Lloyd was unable to keep the horse on the
right road, and it ran down the activity with the greatest force, falling
into a pit at the angle of the road, and being killed on the instant. The
violent concussion threw one of the children completely over the
driving-seat upon the horse, but it fortunately escaped without injury.
The rest of the party, five in number, were thrown out, but escaped with
a few bruises.—Worcester Journal.
Hyde Park, on Saturday afternoon, was the scene of
much animation, at four o'clock, it having become known that the Queen
had resumed her equestrian exercises. Her Majesty was on horseback,
with her suite, two hours►.

On Friday night a party of six men attempted to
steal the young rooks from their nests in the grounds of Intake, the resi-
dence of Mr. Ward. The family being alarmed by the barking of the
house-dog, Mr. Ward, accompanied by one of his house servants, went
out of the house to prevent the depredation from taking place, when the
fellows knocked them down, and beat the servant with a pitch-fork in
so cruel a manner that his death is hourly expected, no hopes being
entertained of his surviving.—SWield
The trade of Paisley is every day becoming worse,
nor is there any prospect of improvement. The spring trade, with the
exception of a comparatively small quantity of fancy goods, has proved
an entire failure, as it nos been found impossible to realize cost prices
for the grea';er part of goods Cla. have been made.—Greenock Ad-
vertiser.

On Wednesday se'nnight a ti:e
I.nke out in the
plantations in the Forest of Dean, Gloucester,
%,„...h .ould not be got
wider until nearly seventy-flve ,--porty of
acres of beautiful timber, a,.
the Crown, had been totally consumed. Between two and the.. . ,7--
ered persons were employed in cutting passages in the plantation,
order to draw off the dry fern and the cuttings and trimmings of last
year, by which means the tire was kept from extending.—Cheltenham
Gazette.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE SUN.

SlR,—My attention having been called to a paragraph in your Paper,
of yesterday's date, which implies a doubt as to the cause f,f my losing
the appointment of Vice-Chamberlain to her Majesty, I can have no he: i.
tation in informing you that it was solely on account of my vote in favour

I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your obedient servant,

ELECTION COMMITTEES.
(YESTERDAY.

(From our Second Edition of last night.)
DEVIZES.

The Committee sat at eleven o'clock, Lord Viscount Eastnor in the
Chair.

Mr. Sergeant Mermveather, Mr. Thesiger, and Mr. ‘Vtangham, np.
peared for the petitioners ; Mr. Austin, and Mr. Co!Immo for the sitting
Member.

Mr. Serjcant MEREWEATIMR opened the case, and explained that
the return was questioned on account of a greater number of tendered
votes on behalf of Mr. Heneage, which were refused, and which
if accepted, would have given him the majority ; and there was
also an allegation of bribery against the sitting Member. The
Learned Sergeant went first into the case of the tendered and rejected
votes, and the case of James Smallbones had not been concluded at half_
past three, when the Comiaittee adjourned.

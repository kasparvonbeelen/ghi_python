LOIV DON,
.1 ULY 9► 1804.

Paris Papers•teached town yesterday, to the 27th
alt. which state the execution of Grunters, and
eleven other Prisoners, on the morniing of the 25111.
They were taken• from the Bicetre to the Con.
ciergerie, , where they heard the terrific decision
of • Gallic justice 1 11 They. only desired that
a Priest" ,might be permitted to attend them in
their last. moments, and this was 'readily grant_
.
ed them. Groacis was particulary devour, and
remained two hours with his Confessor. Be.
tweet) eleven and twelve, thil, were, put into four'
carts, and convoyed to the'Phte‘t de Greve, where
they were guillotined. Every one of them, it is
said, was distinguigred by a dignifita furryierl, the
noble result of a loyalty that could. not be subdued
by misfortune or death. As they were on eve
of being launched into eternity, dicey exclaimed
with heroic intrepidity, " Ie Roi, Vive
Lours XVf.P." • GEORGES was the first of
these victims of Corsican usurpation, and his 'firm
and manly example gave spirit 'to the .whole, if
any of them, indeed, could 'want resolution to
support them in a cause so honourable to their
Principles as "Loyal Frenchmen. The fate of
GEOR`GES deserves patticula regret, as he had been
so long and so 4etively.engaged in attempting to re.
sist the Regibide Governors of France, and to
restore his' unfortunate Sovereign to the Throne,
of his ancestors... The, sacrifice of this gallant
Loyalischas made a great impression on the people,
though they dare not at present avow their feelink.s,

The wretCheit slavery, however, -which the F:gneli
entlure, after so much blood has been shed, lc; change
a 'lawful Monarch. for a foreign I.J,urpet, cannot
render them mach longer blind to the enormities of
their Tyiant,, however he ma'p attempt to dazzle
them v..ith 'the splendor of a Corimiation.

THE Message which, as 'we expqted, WAS tie._
livered to the House of Commons on Saturday, and
which caused so many specuktions, is merely the
usual Message delivered at the close of every• Ses.
sion during 'War, to enable the Minister to propose
a Vote of Credit in the Committee of Supply. The
Vote of Credit will probably be Two Millions and
a Half. •

has reached either the India House or the Admiral-

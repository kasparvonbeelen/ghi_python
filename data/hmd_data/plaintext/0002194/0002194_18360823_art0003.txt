The following distinguished personages arrived here
on Thursday afternoon by the splendid stam-ship City of
Glasgow, Captain Robert Ewing, we believe principally on
their way to their respective seats, after a very short and plea-
sant voyage:—The most Noble the Marchioness of Hastings,
family, and suite ; the most Noble the Marquis of Douglas
and Clydesdale ; Lord Stanley; Lord de Tabley ; Major
Swineburne and Lady ; besides many other persons of rank
and title. The vessel called at the Isle of Man, the Point of
Ayre, and other places, on her way, and, notwithstanding this
unusual delay, we understand performed her voyage to Greenock
in considerably less than 20 hours, and the nobility and
gentry on board expressed themselves very highly gratified,
both with the elegant accommodation of the vessel, and the
manner in which every thing was conducted on board.—

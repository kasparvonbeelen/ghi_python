vassiduously considered by persons who are sincerely desi-

be on the means by which alone this desirable object can
Atatected and perrnanentlysecured. If we reflect on the Divine
end of of our existence, on the nature of our being, and on the
for th °or creation, we will be convinced that we were intended
Nee t°.loyment of perpetual happiness, and that, if the Di-
,,Onnands
St had been obeyed from the beginning, neither
ekness, nor any other calamity could have occurred to
silo ;Met our felicity. One act of disobedience committed by
tar‘driSt parents caused them to be expelled from the terrestrial
terra se, and subjected the whole human race to suffer
Itedeents, from which dreadful fate we were saved by the Divine
slwe'mer having paid our ransom. This unmerited favour

donor of sin, the cause of the infinite sufferings which he en-
Vil for the love of us, and of all the evils that ever have or can

DEFERRED ANNUITIES DEPARTMENT.
By the plan exclusively developed by the Society, a single
deferred annuity is made, net only to answer the same object,
but to equal in amount the entire sum of all the advantages
heretofore only obtained by the middle and industrious classes
by separate investments in Savings' Banks, Benefit Societies,
and Loan Banks.
1. A small yearly or weekly contribution will secure the
most ample return for after life; thus-21. 12s. per annum (Is.
a week) at 20 will at 65 give the policy holder the choice of an
annuity for life of 471. 16s. 6d.: 3941. 11s. in cash; er policy
without further contributions of 4661. at death.
2. Two-thirds at any time lent on deposit of policy, being a
fund always available during sickness or want of employment.
S. Two-thirds of all payments returned to representatives in
case of premature death.
The report to the Annual General Meeting of Proprietors,
prospectuses, tables, &c., may be obtained at the office of the
Society, by letter or otherwise, 26, Cornhill, London, or at
any of its Branches throughout the country.

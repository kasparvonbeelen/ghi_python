BRAZIL-SLAVE TRADE.

Papers received from Rio de Janeiro contain
a decree against the slave trade, which the im-
portations into Brazil have too long and too
effectually supported. The law, if faithfully exe-
cuted, seems well calculated to put an end to
the nefarious traffic, for the suppression of which
it is enacted. This important document ap-
pears in the Diario do Governo of the 23d of
Nov. last, and is to the following effect :
" The Regency, in the name of the Emperor Don Pedro
11., makes known to all the subjects of the empire, that
the Ger.eral Assemb'y has decreed and sanctioned the
following Lim.
" Article I. All slaves who may enter the territory or
p erts of Brazil, from abroad, are free.

" Are excepted—
" 1. Slaves registered in the service of ships hi-longing
to a country in which slavery is permitted to exist, while
employed in the service of the said vessels.
"2. Those who fly from a foreign territory or foreign
vessels, who shall be delivered to the masters who claim
them, and re-exported from Brazil.
" With respect to the ca-es of exception ; first, the
list of the number of slaves shall be produced on entering
inwards, with the declarations necessary for verifying
the same, and proving the identity of the individuals;
and on clearing out it shall he ascertained whether the
vessel has the lime slaves on board as she had on her
arrival. Such of the slaves as may be found after the
sailitig of a vessd shall be apprehended, and detained
until removed front the country.
" 11. rite importers of slaves into Brazil shall be
liable to the corporal penalty inflicted by Article 179 of
the Criminal Code, on those who reduce free persons to
slavery, and to the fine of 200,000 rein per head for each
slave imported; besides to the payment of the expense of
re-exportation to any part of Africa. This re-exportation
the Government shall cause to be cirried into effect with
the least possible delay, after treating with authorities in
Africa for an asylum to the slaves. Violators of the law
shall be conjointly and severally responsible.
" 111. Importers are—

knowingly supply funds, er for any motive give aid
or favour the same, by assisting the landing, or permitting
it on their estates.

" 4. Those who purchase as slaves individuals declared
free by Article 1. These, however, stand only bound
secondarily to make good the expense of re-exportation;
nevertheless they remain subject to the other penalties.
‘• IV. It any vessels trading in slaves he taken without
the ports of Brazil, by national ships, the same shall be
proceeded with, according to the provisions of Articles 1
and 2, as if the seizure had been made within the ports of
the empire.

of discovering any number of persons imported as slaves—
or who, without having lodged any previous declaration,
or obtained any judicial order, shall make any such seizure,

local authority, such information of the landing of free
pei sons as slaves as may lead to their apprehension, shall
receive from the public treasury 30,000 rein for each in-
dividual so seized. _ _

" VI. The coananders, officers, and sailors of vessels
which make seizures of the kind mentioned in Article 4,
are entitled to the produce of the fine, which shall be shared
by them according to the naval regulation for the division
of prize-money.
" VII. No freed man, who is not a Brazilian, shall be
permitted to land in the ports of Br,ail under any pretext
whatever. If such disembark, they shall be immediately

re- exported.

" AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY.

" Dismststra.â€”The undersigned, in behalf of the Executive
Committee of the ' American Anti-Slavery Society,' and of other
leading friends of the cause, now absent from the city, beg the at-
tention of their fellow-citizens to the following disclaimer :
".1. We entirely disclaim any desire to promote or encourage
intermarriages between white and coloured persons.
" 2. We disclaim and entirely disapprove the language of a hand
bill recently circulated in this city, the tendency of which is
thought to be to excite resistance to the laws. Our principle is,
that even hard laws are to be submitted to by all men, until they
can by peaceable means be altered.
" We disclaim, as we have already done, any intention to dis-
solve the Union, or to violate the constitution and laws of the coun-
try, or to ask of Congress any act transcending their constitutional
powers, which the abolition of slavery by Congress in any state
would plainly do.

JACKSON MoNEY.-.The Bank papers, since the Gold Bill
passed the Senate, have left off their marvellous witty jokes
about " Jackson money." They have done the deed, however,
and it is now too late to repent. The name of Jackson is now
identified with metallic money, and those who bestowed the
cowmen by way of ridicule would be glad to withdraw it
again ; but the people -will not let them. They are opposed
to Bank rags, and ilia favour of " Jackson money."

pri.dencies—we are ready to wish that the while
population of these splendid region hid yet been
enawskened by the voice of liberty, and had con•
tinned to sleep in golden chains for ages to Mlles
dreaming of wealth, mid sloth, and voloptatios-
neso, even though the wretched ludiuns were still
colidensned, as their ancestors for ten generation
have been, to be mere beasts of burden, with this
distinction from the brutes shut perish, that they
have immortal souls, though they know not that
they hare them. This latter degradation alowt's
however, were sufficient to make us feel. that
though it be through perils worse than fire and
flood, than hurricane and earthquake, that they
must pass to redeem themselves front this slavery—
it will be well that those perils should be braved,
because in the issue they must be overcome, and
emancipation from personal bondage will prepare
the people and the way to emancipation from
mental and spiritual thraldom, a million times
more to be deplored, and deprecated, and resisted,
than all the fetters that hands can bind on limbs,
and all the agonies that flesh and blood can bear
from temporal oppression.
These lucubrations, particularly in reference to
Mexico, have been suggested by the circumstance
of this most ancient and magnificent of the Spanish
contineutal dependencies, having not only Grown off
allegiance to what is culled, in the mockery of po-
litical language, the mother country—a stepmo-
ther, indeed, Spain has been to all her stolen chil-
dren—but has chosen an Emperor for itself, of •
new dynasty, neither descended from the Monte-
zurnas nor the Bourbons. Iturbide the Fiisf has
assumed the purple ; but to speculate on the length
of his reign to clime, would be to put to sea with-
out chart or comesss, and those that are wise will
wait patiently fur the great interpreter of mysteries
—time—in reveal all that curiosity itself can desire
to kuow concerning him. Mexico is the Arabia
Felix of the New World, in its rich and exquisite
productions for supplying the vomits, or romistetiog
to the comforts and luxuries of man ; while, either for
empire or commerce, it is more advantageously
situated than any other nation under the sun, lying
principally within the tropics, and stretching
through many degrees of latitude, an irregularly
winding istlosius, between the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans, that temper its climate with their breezes,
and whose waters are ever ready to waft its treasures
to the ends of the earth, and bring home in ex.
change the riches of every other nation. In such
a land, if man is degraded and miserable, the fault
is neither in nature nor Providence, and if he re-
mains so, he well deserve all that afflicts him, for
lie is his own tormentor.

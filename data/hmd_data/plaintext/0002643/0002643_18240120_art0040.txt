LORD BATHURST'S CIRCULAR TO Mr
COLONIES.

Colonial Office, Downing-street, July 9,114
In my despatch of the
that it was my intention to cot»municate to you, by the fun
Packet in the present month, further instruction, respect.
mg those improvements in the Slave Code of the Culoo,
under your Government, which, in conformity with IL;
recent Resolutions of the House of ('onnnotis, it ;sthi
earnest desire of his Alaj( sty's Government to carry ic;ii
tin et.

The suggestions which I am about to make are nixt,
be understood as affording a full developement of shit la
:overnment have in contemplation on this le,
portant subject. It is my purpose rather to point out siv4
changes in the law as may he conveniently adopted at prt.
sent, and which will, it is hoped, lay the foundation fcta
further and more effectual refOrmetion. lam thcrefue
direct you to lay before the Colonial Legislature of
the following remarks and propositions; and you will tp
fail to press upon that body the importance of ditecit,
their immediate and most s: rious attention to them.

It would be superfluous to insist upon the
necessity of religious instruction, as the foundation cif ern,
beneficial change in the character and future condition
the Slaves. So dteply, indeed, is his Majesty's Gc
inent impress al with tif.a truth, and with the

of mainiaining an ath quate numbrr of Clergymen
Teachers througlymt the Al'est underEpir-
trol, that if it shall appear that the revenues of thi
arc insufficient lOr this purpose, they will not helii

apply to Parliament for such pecuniary grants r ma,
necessary for supplying the deficiency ; nor can
doubt that the anxiety which has been manifested 'el
Legislature, and by the public at large, for the welly
the Slave population, will induce Parliament cheerful
contribute such funds ar may be required for cffectingib
important objcct. But this disposition must he meta
the part of the Assembly by a ltgislative proviaiot
abolition of markets on the Sunday, and the subs:'l,
of some other time for that purpose, so that the S.abtaj
may be appropriated to the purpos.a of rest from labor,
and of moral and religious instruction. Unless the tits
withdrawn from the market were employed in the It
becoming occupations of the day, it would, too p alai
be passed by the slaves without benefit to themseh
perhaps widt material detriment, if not danger, t.
community. The linmediate abolition of Sunday war
is not insisted upon until, the means of religious

shall have bee; provided. But his Majesty's Govt,
will not recommend to Parliament the grant of any
litany assistance towards the expense of a r:ligioe
blishment. in any case in which the abolition of G.
markets, and the substitution of some ether day for
purpcse, shall not have been prospectively secured.
Religious instruction is also a necessary prelimina,
another important improvement in the condition of t
slaves, the admission of their evidence in Courts ofJutri
The permanent exclusion of the testimony of slaves
esscntially interfere with the provisions adopted for
protection. On the other hand, to declare that all
shall be qualified to give evidence, would be a chanr
the system of administering justice in the Colonies,
momentous to he intrethiced suddenly; it can only
sequent upon the nuns' and religions improvement
slave population. It is highly expedient, therefor:,
in furtherance of the res@nuons unanimously adopt.
the Ilouse of Commons, a law should be passed dee
that the evidence cf a slave shall be received in all

perhaps, certain cases. if upon his appearing in Coe
give test:mony he shall produce, under the hand eit!
some of the parochial clergymen, or et' the rull
Teacher, authorised by the Master or Overseer, to
him, a certificate, stating that the proposed witntss
been so far instructed in the principles of religion as.
the judgment of the party certifying, adequately to or
stand the obligation of an oath. The casts to be.
sidered must be those in which the master of dr
slaves is directly concerned, and such as iresl
affect the life of a white person. For the better preset*
the fabrication of certificate-a, it may he necessary to Ital
parochial registers of the persons whose competency
give evidence shall, from time to time, have been eyrnief
by the proper authority ; and the being enrolled in swill
list may be made an object or laudable ambition, and s s.
mitts to attention and good conduct. Perhaps scams
tificate should not of itself be an absolute qualification
be received as a witness, but it mit.tht be regiiirle4as rii
ing such a pis sumptien of competency, that the Arty prs
during it should be taken and adjudp cl to be compost;
unless he should be proved to labour nitiler some such ;Ls
ability as would, according to the law and usage of E
lid) Courts of Justice, disqualify a free pc rson.
Riigious instruction is not less m ressarily the f
tion of that relatisn, the want of which, in the sy:
colonial slavery, excites a deep and general cottris2n
in this country--that of marriage. Where the ctalj
and parental tights of the father of a family cannot
maintained, it would be vain to expect front this insti
tiun that infinite variety of salutary consequ-nets
naturally belong to it in civilized society. The
want of religious teachers in the colonies presents an.
difficulty, for, without their instrumentality, it s.
scarcely be possible to impress the mind of a slave
due sense of the sacred obligations of matrimony, or ere
to celebrate the mere ceremonial of marriage with any ir
per and impressive solemnity.
Advantage cannot be too soon or too anxiously tarn'
the opportunity of establishing this salutary institution;
doing so, care must be taken to encourage, as far as ,
ble, marriages between slaves attached to the same ester
since the insecurity orconiugal and parental rights is use
firstly increased by distant connections, which inor
tend to withdraw the interest and attachment of the.
from the plantation to which be belongs. As part of
system, provision ought to be trade by law for exen,

Britain, alas ! has wood in rain,
Reluctant Peace, thy placid charms ;
Compell'tl, she treads once snore th' ensanguin'd plain,
Where Fame, where Freedom call aloud fur arms.

Yet be awhile the battle's sound
In notes of festive triumph drownl
Whether the fiends of Discord fly
tortentous through the fiery sky,
Or, bound in Fate's coercive chain,
Howl 'mid th' infernal seats in vain,
On this auviciotii day the %fuse,
Jocund, with grateful voice!, her wonted theme pursue;

Amid the boast of tyrant pride,
The p‘,liip of ;tats, the arm'd array,
Can all the shouti of slavery bide
That slave; unwilling homage pay
No force can shield Ambition's head
From noontide care, from midnight dr:•ad,
When the still monitor within
Searches di' abode of blood and sin :

While whu rules with virtuous sway,
Whoru freemen glory to obey,
Sees every brrrist the bulwark of a thrall!.
116 people's surest guard, it, ~errd rights thrir own.

Then let the Mnse, with duteous hand,
Strike the bold ly rt.*, respon:ive strings,
While every tongue through Albion's land
Joins in the hymn Of praise she sings i
And Labour, from the furrow'd plain,
And Commerce, from the billowy main,
With voice symphonious bid arise
That purest incense to the skies,
Above the proudest wreath of fame,
Which ever grac'd the victor's name,
A nation's votive „breath by truth emisigu'd
To bless a patriot King—the friend of human kind

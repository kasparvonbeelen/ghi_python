DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST ALGIERS.

In consequence of advices which have been received from
the Mediterranean, it has been deemed necessary by his
Majesty's government, to declare hostilities against the
Regency of Algiers. A notification to this effect appeared
in Saturday's Gaz• tie, stating, that the lky, having re-
fused to make reparation for an insult °Wens! to the British

he had
determination a tiimonu
bound
himself not to retain any Christian captives, of any
cation, in a nude of slavery, war is therefore declared
against him.
We understand that the Admiralty will immediately pro-
vide due convoy for the protection of merchants' ships in the
Mediterranean.
The news was brought by the ('amelion, Capt. Burton,
which
arrived at Faimouth. It appears that the Naiad,
Capt. Spencer, and the Cainelion, were despatched to
Algiers to demand some explanations ; which being refused,
they ran in under the batteries, and commenced tiring on
an Algerine current., on board of which were some Spanish
1 captives, about to be carried into slavery. This was an in-
fraction of the treaty between Algiers and this country, by
which Christian slavery was abolished. The corvette was
captured, together with the captain, the crew, and the
seventeen Spanish prisoners, who were on board.

It has been remarked that the Nladrid flume has not published
any of the addresses presented by the cities or corporations in which
the Inquisition wan spoken of. This has created a belief that that
tribunal will not he re-established, notwithstanding all the repre-
'citations that have been made by the clergy.
The following is the language whah in now held by the Servile',
on the subject of the mode of assessment of the tax sought to be
established by the Minister of Finance:—
They speak of a new plan of administration, according to the
modern system. It appears that M. Lopez Ballesterom is another
sray, and that, according to the latter's example, he will establish
a landed contribution. We would counsel him to act with refloat
Lion, in order to avoid the mint grievous consequences.
In the tint Ses.ions of the tones, the l'eputy Ca/dereo said, In
speaking of the direct contribution, that it had, in 1814, brought
on the destruction of the Constitution, and that the landed tonal-
bat on adopted from the plan of liarsy, cottoned, in 1820, the re-ests-
blishment of the Constitution, which had not met any obstacle, and
that it would destroy a second time the same Constitution. This
is the opinion of an enemy. Although it may be so, it would
be a very great error to give up to a nation which was ig-
nurant of the word slidislityte, on the correct perception of the wis-
dom of instituting a land-tax, the mode established for recovering
the civil fruits under Charles M.
ST. PETTIIPMYROH, Ja.x. 30.

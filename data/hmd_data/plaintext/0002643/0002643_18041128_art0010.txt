, A few days ago a vessel was stranded on the
sands of Buffington, and three unfortunate mariners
-end a cabin-boy saved themselves from immediate
destruction by clinging to the mast. The sza ran
• mountains high ; no man durst venture to their aid,
when Collect Pi rrs, commanding the Volunteer
Corps at Burlington Quay, with the assistaece of his
Lieutenant, ventured out in an open boat, and at
the hazard of his own life saved theirs.
The successor of St. PETER has given to the
world a new instance of the slavery in which he is
held by the Corsican. He is indeed completely
fallen from his high estate, a.:d has had the mean-
ness to add to his degradation a falsehood. 'Who
tan be in stupid as to believe His HOLINLSS when
,he says, that the interests of religion constitute the
'principal object of his journey to Paris ? He would
have told but the truth, had he declared that all his
reluctance and scruples were overcome by the impe-
-rious commands of the Emperor NT.sein roe, and
'that, dragged like a captive in chains, the only ob-
ject of his journey is t confer, by his presence,
pomp and splendour on Ow coronation.
About five o'clock. Sunday morning, a stable,

his guard-bed, in the bay-loft, at that part of the
building which first fell, though much cut and bruis-
ed, was able to give an alarm, that soon brought

EDINBURGH, Nov. 24.
—.....--

COURT OF SESSION.
OR the With inst. the Court determined a curious
and important question respeEting a wager. In May,
1797, two Gentlemen had entered into a contra t,
regularly written and executed upon stamped paper,
that in case at any time in the course of 10 years,
the value of 1001. sterling in the 3 per cent. consols
should rise to above 701. sterl. the one should pay to
the other one hundred pounds sterling, with inter-
est, after the same should fall due. On the other
hand, the other party was to pay one hnndred
pounds sterling, if the 3 per cent. cons. did not rise to
701. i 5 ten years, and both patties blond their heirs
and executors to perform this agreement. One of
the gentlemen died, and the other, the present pur-
suer, when the 3 per cent. consol, rose to 701.
brought the present aaion against the brother and
heir of the dec••ased geialemaii, who admitted he
was heir, and liable for the payment of all his bro.
titer's just debt;. It was contended on the one
hand, that this was a gaming wager, and no aEtion
could lie upon it. It was contended on the
other hand, that this was not a gaming wager,
such as horse ►neill:, money lost at cards, dire. &c.
Ent a fair contraa. The question came before Lord
DANK AT vtrz, Ordinary, who found that " the con-
tra4l libelled was not anionable in this Court, arid
assoilzied the defender." The Lord Ordinary
afterward; ordered informations. and reported the
ease to the Court, when their Lordships found " that
the contra libelled on is not actionable in this
Court, and therefore assoilzied the defender, and
find the pursuer liable in exper.ces."

JERSEY, N0v.21.

All has been bustle here with embarking and dis-
embarking troops. Or the 18th, in the evening,
the 2d battalion of the 69th regiment arrived here
is four days from Portsmowh Next morning it
Was in General Orders fir 300 of th• io to disem-
bark ; and the s:tme niimlet of men, with theil bag-
gage, &c. it:. bel,nging lo the Ist battalion of t; e
5.4 th, to embark in the transports front which the
others were to disembark. The same evening other
orders rime our, that the whole of the 69th were to
disembark and march to Granville hayracks, and
the detachment of the .'.Bth ordered not to toihark.
The reason of th..te contradienry orders, it i said,
arose frran the circumstance that the transports were
not stiffrient to contain the wh le of the 58th. It
is said that this Island is to be garrisoned entir:ly
wit ti second battalions, and that all the first batta.
lions will go on service.
An (ado came for all the men in the Ist Ganison
Battalion (late Ist Reserve), fit for iltive home ser-
vice, to be disposed of as ft Bows—The men f-om
the City of I‘in&n, to be auached to the 2.1 batta-
lion of the 3d or BufFs, now in Aldarney ; the men
from Middlesex to go to the fld battalion 83d, at
Horsham Barracks; and the men from the Tower

All talk of invasion here seems totally at an end.

A consi.lerahle conc. fuse of people a.se-vbied
early on Nlond.oy morning on the ro ol to Worn--
wood Scrubs, for the purpo,e of wit— eong a fight
between Two Belays, cousin to the acknowleJged
champion, and -- Rofi:t, nephew to the late
pugilist of that name, who fought with Johnson some
years since. The parties have b.' n a month in
training, and the fight. which was anxiously looked
for, and which was to have been decisled yesterday,
was put off until Monday the 3d of December, to
the disappointment of some hundreds of peiple, on
account of a misunderstanding relative to the pater
to be fought for. Be/eber foug!A his first bettle with
Ward some months since, in which he was not suc-
cessful. Ryan, who is the favourite, has never yet
fought a pitched battle, although he is known to be
a skilful and a Antrum man. Bill Wurd will second
Belcher ; and R as will be seconded by Tem Jsues.
A battle was fought near to the White Eloise Cel-
lar. Piccadilly, on Friday, between W. Milian's, a
Western stage coachman, and a country farmer.
After some very severe rounds, victory was declared
in favour of Ceerive, who possesses much science in
the art, and who left the countryman some frightful
marks of his dexterity. The farmer has since wish-
ed to fight in an honourable may, but Withisew ex-
pressed his ignorance of that art.
On Wednesday evening arrived at WNtby, the
brigantine usbet,y, of and bound to Sunderland,
Aaron THOMPSON, Master, having the preceding
evening, about four o'clock, been captured off the
Spurn by a brig cutter privateer of sixteen guns,
18-pounders, and carr) inn 150 men. Mr. Tr/ wee-
SON being ordered on board the privateer was enter.
tamed with great kindress by the commander, who
informed him, that light vessels were not his obje:R,
but that he had come upon that part of the coast for
the purpose of looking out for the Hull traders.
After a good deal of conversation (during which
Mr, THOMPSON learnt that the privateer was the
same vessel which some months since engaged
the Proiceet Augusta cutter, Lieutenant TRACY,
on the Yorkshire coast), the commander was
prevailed upon to allow Mr. THOMPSON to re-
turn to his vessel, and to proceed on his voyage.
The privateer had some time before captured a
sloop laden with pester, belonging to Aberdeen,
the master of which, Mr. Atone aw Ino strum, was
permitted to go it.:o the beesstsy, and is landed at
Whitby. The mate of the latter vessel was, however,
conveyed on board the privateer, and carried off in
her. Mr. Trine 'son reports, that the enemy's vessel
is painted black, and had an uncommonly white jib,
her guns were likewise hauled within hoard for the
purpose of disguise : he dots not consider her as a
very fast sailer, as she did not come up with
.ladessit.ii, till after a very to •.g chug.

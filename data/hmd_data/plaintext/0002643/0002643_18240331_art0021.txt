PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE.

PUBLIC DEBT.
Mr. Speerman, from the Treasury, presented the annual accounts
tasting to the public debt.
COLONIAL SLAVERY.
Lad CAI.THORPE presented a petition from the Inhabitants
e(• place in Gloucestershire, praying the House to adopt measures
for the gradual abolition of colonial slavery. The Noble Lord pre-
owned • ler petitions from (Inkhorn, in Rutlandshire ; and
Waably, in Herefordshire; as did the Earl of Morley, from Ply-
mouth, d Modbury, in Devonshire ; and the Duke of Montrose,
beta Pitcaithley, in ritirlinphire, •hit ware severally laid on the

principle had ban recognised on the western coast of Africa. So
far from offering any opposition to this Bill, he begged of the
Noble Earl to accept of his best thanks, for the teal that he bad
sbewn in bringing it into and carrying it through the House.
The Earl of HA RROWBY said that the American Congress,
in making slavery piracy, had acted distinctly from this country, and
the treaty was a separate measure from that act of Congress. as en
the Bill perfectly, distinct that was then in progress through
Parliament from that State paper. The Acts of the respective Le.
matures were independent of the treaty. The actual passing of
the Bill was desirable on account at the Congress being now
and it was ofimportance that it should arrive in America before that
Assembly broke up. He could see no objection to invite the other
Powell to accede to the terms of the convention.
The Bill was then read a third time and passed.—Adjourned.

FROM LAST NIGHT'S GAZETTEE.

Admiralty Office, AprSl 25, 1826.
Cony of a Letter from Commodore Sir Jame% Brisbane, C.B. to
John Wilson Croker, Esq: dated on hoard the Honourable COrn
Pany's steam-vessel Diana, above Prome, on the Irawaddy, the
341 December, 1825.
Sta,—The enemy having approached Proem in large bodied of
men, evidently with the intention of drawing a line of circtunvel..
latiin round the British position ; I beg you will be pleased in in-
form the Lir a Commissioner of the Admiralty that the Com-
mender of the Forces moved out on the lot instant, for the purpbee
of attacking the left column, a short distaece in the intenor, *d
requested that I would, at the same time, make a diversion in his
favour, be entroging the enemy's centre position at Pagoda Point,
with the flotilla under my immediate command. It is extremely
strung both by nature and muPand ssituated on *e left bake
the river, a few miles in odranee of Promt. I aril happy ter. ay
thatsthe ',Ault of these arrant entente was decidedly faedursble4, the
enemy's let's column. onmit,treg of shout fourteen thousand filen.

by an attack uenn Pagoda PFent, the abject of she formwedaversim, ;

'a cannonading or soientl bouts, the troops rushed forded 48 the
asseoh--aiveresuie the natural *stades which presented themselves
.—aril eaiglad the position in the most gallant style. The flmilla at
the same time pushed on op the river, stad captured the whole of
the enemy'. limos (atootiottng to about three hundred), together
with several goes, tour hundred muskets, and a large quantity o
storm

I hare met satis'action in stating that the whole of the Officers
and men etc pipit d in the floira, 'conducted themselvts throughout
thiagervice :n a manner that reflects the highest credit on each tu-
drrlssolle conflate.. as .Wirs..frre.; is, 4 various coablishrneota.
The Officers ot the Ronnorable Company's Marine vied with those
of the Royal Navy in gallantry and exertion. Captain Childs, of
the Alligator, who commanded the light division. displayed the
same :eel. judgment, and intrepidity, which have characterized his
eondtet since the operations in this quarter began. 1 have, how.
ever, the painful duty of announcing the death of CaptainJoba
Dawson, of the Amebae, wham high professional character had
induced me so recently to promote him to the rank of Commander.
The gaUantry of this much-lamented Oißeerwas conspicuous en all
°ecotone, inviting by his example the exertions of all under bis
direction ; he fell just as success had crowned our efforts.
I cannot close this letter without expressing my admiration of
the steadiness, good order, and discipline of the troops,in cleansing
along a line of march, intersected with thirk jungle, and a succes-
sion of intrenchments, until the storming took place. The twosome
of his Majesty's strvice are in full and hearty co-operation for the
objects of the present expedition ; and oval, success way be hoped
for from the perseverance and resolution of Sir Archibald Camp-
bell, the distinguished Commander of the Forces.
1 have the honour us be, &c.

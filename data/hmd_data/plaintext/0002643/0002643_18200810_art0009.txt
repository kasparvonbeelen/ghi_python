be traced between this Memorial and the " excel-
lent English muskets" that now arm the insurgent
peasantry of 'Galicia. But the evil cannot extend
far, for should its effects once become visible in the
altered aspect of our public relations with Spain,
there is still,ivirtue enough left in Parliament to
interfere with strong hand, and rescue the charac-
ter and the best iuterests of the -empire from be-

principles of foreign despots.

LON DON,
Aram 6, 1821.

Lord CRANIORNE last night, in the !louse of
Commons, moved for the appointment of a o=-
044. e-to inqui►e into the -state of the Game Law*,
with a view► to, modifying that black *ad tetra •al
plit'of our Criminal Code, which is a disgrace to
the character of oir country. The sportsmen,
however, outnumbered the men of humanity, and
defeated the motion by a majority of 86 igainst
Mr. Cuawais moved for leave to bring in a BA
for the repeal of the Husbandry Horse Tait bit
after some discussion the Hon. Member was in-
duced to withdraw bis notion, on the understand-
ing that he should await the Report of the Com-
mittee upon the agricultural distresses of the

country.
The Timber Duties Bill went through • COW-
miltee of the House. During the discusiiiin of
the several chimes the attendance of Members
was far from being so numerous as might have been
expected from the great importance of the subject.

We bade received Paris Papers of Moats), last.
The Austrian troops entered Naples on the 23d of
March, sad defiled. before the King's Palace,
where were the Pam.' REGENT and his brother
the Prince of &swum. An immense concourse
of people, we are told, were assembled there, dad
expressed their applause of the KING, and saluted
with joyous acclamations the troops of his anloWt
ally. The Neapolitans must indeed be enamoured
of slavery and disgrace if this representation be cot-.
rect. What ! exult in the conquest of their capi-
tal, and salute with joyous acclamations the troops
who had come to destroy by violence their every
prospect of liberty, and who have been the instru-
ments its the hands of military despots to insult and
oppress their country in the eyes of Europe ! It is
utterly impossible that any considerable number of
Neapolitans could have joined in cilebratiag their
own humiliation, and more particularly that they
could have chases' the presence of the Duke of
CALABRIA and his brother to give utterance to

such traitorous acclamations. -
The Duke of CALABRIA is no longer Regent of
the kingdom ; his father, by a Royal Ordinance
dated at Florence, the 15th of March, suited •
Provisional Government to administer the affairs of
the kingdom until his MAJESTY'S return, and of
this Committee of Government the Marquis CIR.
CELLO is appointed the President. The Ministry
of War and the affairs of the Church are intrusted
to General FARDELL•, but we must confess our
inability to comprehend his MAJESTY'S motives for
making so singular and apparently so inconpuom
an onion.
The Journals of Naples contain a copy of a letter
which the KING wrote to the Pataca KEGRSIT, in
answer to the communication of which General
FARDELLA was lately the bearer. This letter gives
us some intimation of the character of that which
the Prince had written to his father. His Manual'
says, " The reasonings into which you enter would
seem to point at me as the cause of the evils of the
war which afflicts my kingdom." The Prince, it►
all probability, deplored to his father the dreadful
consequences that have followed from his MAAS
TVS having forgotten the solemn pledge which he
had giveu to the Parliament and people of No.
pits, that be woWld never countenance or ac-
knonledge any measures proposed by the Allies

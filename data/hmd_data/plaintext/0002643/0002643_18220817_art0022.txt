STANZAS FOR THE ZING'S LANDING.

The eagle servant spun &tenor',
The wild deer bawds se Cheviot fell ;
Step boldly, King, on Alloys's shore,
Son of her Lord's, Me greets thee well,
The voice that bath bees silent long,
Awakes to harbinger thy path;
Once more she weaves she aseestral song,
thee more 'tis " Rio,. au BRATIII !"

From grey Dan Edin's rattle crest,
Float, Boat, thou Royal Banner wide,
Gleam, gleam more radiant than the rest,
Dear embtent of old Albyn'e pride !
Glow, ruddy Bottom of yore
It wan thy wont, on fields of wrath,
To brighten 'midst she kindling roar
Of Camores " Ram au Mutter

Beam, beam, as white eur bero's cry
Dissolved shy slumbe► of despair,
And raied thee, Nutlike, from our sky
The clonal of slavery to scare.
Aye—as from out the dark Torirond,
The Winer saw thy blazon shine,
When Wallace steeped the folds in blood,
Aed Bong them from the pine.

Iligh sign! as where the coming galley
Of Bruce displayed thee o'er the prow,
And oa indignant bill and valley,
Roused Carrick spear and Arrou bow.
Beam now ; or as, when calm and stern,
He fixed thee in iron sacred atone,
Cosign the mace for Bannockburn,
And ►de the trump be blown.

No ! sacred symbol, Rost as free—.
As bright be tby majestic glance—.
Bat grade all thy splendour be ;
No term tinge the continence !
Beam softly, star of chivalry,
As whro proud Windsor's calk came
To bless, as Scottish lower sad tree,
The welcome of thy flame.

Or beam (bat bar each wormr omen),
As whew the lilied bark drew nigh,
And courteous knights aid stalwart yeomen
Knelt here—even sere—'oestb Mary's eye.
The feudal rage, the zealot gloom,
That quenched the day of that fair morn,
Lie chained together in the tomb
Of eareleatiog scorn.

Another dawn, 1 searee may name,
Saw thee, for princely grootiog, glow ;
Is evil hour a wanderer raw,
For owe, thou Overt the sign of woe:
Trt then, even thew, there was no shame
To stamp the maim of team and blood,
And generous memory mourns to blase
The errors of the good.

Float fairly from Dun Eden's brow,
Primeval poneon of his Fathere—.
Nur tears nor blood shall stout thee now—
No gloom around thy billion gathers.
From itazon firm and fiery Gail,
From moor and mart, from eot and hall,
Ow voice—one heart—goes forth to hail
The Xing—the Sire of All.

Though with the Scottish stream be met
The ►lood of Kings that were sot mine,
Though D'Eallk and Plantagenet
Have blended with the Bruee's lice,
The spirit of departed time
I. in the song that meets thy path,
And lofts ogee more in Albyu's clime
The about of " HMI ou Blunt r

The crown that circled Bruce's helm
Once mere the Douglas' bawd shall raise;
The sword that rescued Brace's realm
Be guarded by the De Is Hayes.
The children of the heath and yew
Come hureemed down from sten and sleuth,
Plant o'er their crests the White and Blue,
And swell the " RIGUI GU Bags:"

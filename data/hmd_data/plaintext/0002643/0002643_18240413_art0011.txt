NNW CHURCII ES.

Mr. JA M ES presented a petition from the inhabitants of Car-
lisle, against the grant fur budding new churches. The petitioners
peeved humbly, that the money would be much better in the
piethets of the people than in the unuocestory employment Ice
which it seemed to be destined.
Mr. HUME presented a similar petition, signed by 1,200 of the
iehabitants of Manchester. .The petitioners submitted that the ex.
parse of such buildings ought to be defrayed by those who attended
short. Many of the petitioners were Dissenters, and could not
mowientiously visit these places of worship. But they alleged, and
established the allegation on oath, that for these churches there
existed no necessity. The churches of 111anchester at present were
arable of accommodating 4,000 persons, and upon an average they
woe visited by not more than 1,160. At a vestry held in 1820, it
was determined by a large proportion of those who attended that
resting, that there existed no earthly necessity foe another church
in that town, and the resolution was conveyed to the Secretary
of State, Lord Sidmouth.
Sir R. FERGUSON stated a fact applicable to this question, to
which he wished to call the attention of the Chancellor of the Ex.
chequer. In one of the parishes of Edinburgh the population had
i•crouted to the extent of Aar. The church became too small to
hold the congregation, and a chapel of ease was built by a general
subscription of the parishio—era. The population, however, had
Lail" increased still further, and two or three yzars ago the pa-
rishioners agreed to come forward with some additional contribu-
tion, with which, and a sum borrowed, money was raised to build
two more chapels of case. They did not follow the plan of the
Right Hon. Gentleman for throwing these places open for nothing,
bet lot the seats fur an annual rent. About • third part was re-
sotoM for the poor and labouring classes, to whom seats were let
fur a shilliwg a year.
The pets 111121 was ordered to be printed.
‘Mr. HUME then gave notice, that on Wednesday next he would
sieve fur a return at the manner in which the sum of 1,000,1481.
formerly granted to'build churches, had been expended.

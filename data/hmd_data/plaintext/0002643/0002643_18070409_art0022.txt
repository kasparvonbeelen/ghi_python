Last week an award WAS made by JAWS, Lose,
Esq. Barrister ar Law, in the very important cause
of WlLunt and Co. an Benson and Co. respetting
the workings of a colliery, at Greys,arthen. near
Cockermouth. The Plaintiff alleged, that the
lefend.in3 had wilfully abstrated a large quantity
of coal, from grounds under their Royalty; and,
in further aggravation, had thrown various impedi-
ments in the way, to obstrua them in the peaceable
enjoyment of their property. This cause was
twilight to Carlisle, for trial at the last Anises, and
it WAS a solicit of serious disappeinunent to many
persons who had attended on purpose, that it had
not then a hearing, as the dark, complicated, and
mysterious circumstances which it involved, render.
ed ;medic investigation desirable, and must have ex-
cited general interest ; but at the urgent solicitation
of the Defendants, the cause was put to reference,
and Ja am Lose, Esq. was fixed upon as Referee.
The Learned Counsel went into a full examination
of the tidied at Cockermouth, and after •
all the intricacies and subtleties, which the s •
dexterity of art had superadded to the natural
darkness of the inquiry, be made his award last
week in favour of the klaintiffs, Wit. suss and Co.
with damages to the amount of .16,)191. 15s. and
taxed costa.

Don Juan Autortio de Firtdler Bru and de Rubi,
Marquis of \ idled, Count de Mantua, Member-of
the Supreme Board of Govertimeut of the King-
doms of Spain and the Indies, &c.-&c. has issued
the followitig Proclamation :
of Cadiz !—Your safety and de-
fence, have called the whole attention of Govern-
ment. A treacherous and corrit,,t Coruoiander
%%anted to sell cud deliver yon op to the enemy ;
but Cie vigil:nom of the Supreme Board of Govtrii-
uncut of the Kingdom lIIIS averted that calamity,
stud his perfidious machinations have only served
to make the traitor hnown, as,' to sink him into
the mire of his infamy. Be without uneasiness,
loyal inhabitants of Cadiz ; Gwertinient watches
over you. Chiefs of undoubted patriotism at.your
head, anal a Aleitilwr of the Supreme Board iuces-
saintly occupied in promoting your welfare aud hap-
piness, are two guarantees which Ills Majesty
you ii.:;:thist the vile intrigues of the atroci-
ous Napoleon ; what remains then for you to do,
inhabitatits of Cadiz? Nothing but to co-operate
with the so: id intentions of ( .overnment. Your
seal in favour of the State has at all times
been einispicumis in adverse us iu prosperous cir-
cumstances. 'rime merchants of Cadiz have ever
been the first to display their generosity. What
may not, therefore, be expected froto those mer-
chants, at the critical moment whets their own ex-
istenee is endangered Noloaly knows better thou
you, that freudout is the soul of mercantile indus-
try. Turn your eyes to France, compare what the
is to what she was, and infer the fate that awaits
you, if that destructive genius should movers) in
subduing Spain. Inhabitants of Cadiz, this beau-
dna city, the emporium of commerce and opulence,
you would see converted into a deserted village.—
To the evils with which every other town is
threatened, you would see pituider and the
harshest tmatment snperasided. lforir ienrhours
would he left without shipping, and your atoms
without goods ; 3 our merchants would desert their
houses, and the tears of despair would prove your
only ri:souree. I lesitate not, therefore, to make
fresh sacrifices to your security ; they can never he
excessive, when it is the independence of the coun-
try that requires them. Let us be free, anal speedily
will the rapid flight of our commeree, of that
spring of public opidence.atuply indemnify you, fur
sacrifices which you shall have wade to the geuer.sl
defence. (Signed)

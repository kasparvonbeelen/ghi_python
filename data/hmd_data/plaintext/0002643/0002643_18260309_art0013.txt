Mr. H. DRUMMOND brought in a Bill to repeal the Acts of
the Scotch Parliament (ISM, c. 138, and 1 9d, c. 219) concerning
assault and battery pendenic lite. He said those acts of the reign of
James VI, were passed in turbulent and barbarous times. A abort
time previous to the union of Scotland and England the hardship of
the law was evident, and it did not require any arguments to prove
that it was inconsistent with a state of civilised society; by that
law if any assault was committed by a plaintiff in a suit upon the
defendant, pendeatc lite, he lost hie suit, whatever might be the
merits of the case.

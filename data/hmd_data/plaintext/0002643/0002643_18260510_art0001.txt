CORN LAWS.
Mr. PHILLIPS presented a petition from the cotton spinner! of
Manchester. praying for a repeat of the Coro Law& Ifs said, in
some observations which fell from him the other night. he had add
that the !manufacturers were quite competent to discuss and deOide
on the merits of the Corn Laws. lie would now say, that he Oran
led to make that observation from the acute reasoning he pereefetws
to be contained in the pedtions which they had sent to
the House on the subject, and from the observations of
Gentleman who was quite competent to judge who had
been at a meeting of manufacturers. where the question was is.
cussed with a propriety which would have done honour teeny
assembly. A petition had been presented the other nigh; to
the House, front certain machine menufacttirers, coMplainlng of
the restrictions which were laid on the exportation of machinbry.
He wsa sorry Ministers were not then in their places, as it was his
intention to have inquired if they intended to use any means to
give employment to those artisans. Ile thought it was better anise
men should be employed in constructing machines foe the use of
foreigners than to starve for want of employment.
Ordered to be printed.
Mr. HUME said he had presented the petition alluded to. H•
entirely agreed in the sentiments of the Hon. Member (Ale. Phil.
lips), and would on Thursday next move that leavebe granted foe
the exportation of machinery, and that it be placed on the same
footing as other articles of commerce. Ile thought, if they did pot,
that the consequence would be that foreigners would look for ma.
chinery from America.
Mr. HEATHCOTE presented a petition from Boston, against
any alteration in the Corn Laws.
Alr. HUME moved for a return of the number of officers ap.
pointed to first commissions of cavalry, and thence .appointed to
regiments of the line, between the 26th March, 1816, and 25tir
March 1822. The Honourable Gentleman said, his onimtwas
to show that in the year 1812 an enormous return was tarnished.—
Ordered.
Lord MILTON presented a petition from the students ofAl.
bany College, county of York, praying for the abolition of negro
elevery.—Ordered to be laid on the table.
SURPLUS CAPITAL.
Sir T. I,ETHBRIDIIE said he hid to present speeltion to the
House, which was of the utmost importance at the present period,
when distress was so prevalent. It was from Sir John *notate,
who prayed that The unemployed surplus capital of the country
might be used In cultivation of the waste land. The petitioner
suggested this's a profitable way of occupying the poor.—Laid on
the table.

We arc informed, by letters from Frankfort of 10th
March, say the Paris Papers .‘ that the English mer-
chants- in Germany discover great jealousy and unea-
siness in regard to the endeavours of the French to
revive their trade with that country. They view •
with indignation the new' trading establishments in
the different pOrts. They blame France for the•
eare with which Spain now endeavours to protect
her manufaitures, by prohibiting the exportation of
Spanish n &poi. They 'see, with all the feelings of
malicious envy, she vigoroas measures taken on the
Scheldt and Rhine to prevent the importation of En-
glish ntuaufaefures; the encouragement given to those
whciattempt a smuggling trade into England ; and
that decliration of Cherburgh to be a free port for li.
peers and brandy, which Is likely to produce a large •
exportation' of these articles to the opposite coasts
of England' and Ireland. The establishment, itoei
at Chambers, and of a General Council of Commerce
in" France, has given much food for English envyi
'They are still in alarmin -regard to Colonel Sesalo

IleDatavitus, ill cromon with the Germans,
from whom they sprurig, were a fierce, rough, and
}tally race of mortals ; huge of stature, vast of
limb, and of a daring and imperious front, that
bespoke Oeytteintiost contempt of dangers. They
were inured to .all the vicissitudes of the seasons, to
hunger.; cold,: and every hardship :attendant on the
chase of will beasts, or the avocation of war ; the
very seldom *aged, without
having been sustained ; but
i,:. latter,i
ei when
nt
P.trillsee7au.elTnrdvroig;nthatinegsoyn was once aroused, it was as
difficult to elude as to assuale their • vengeance.
Among the bravest nations of Germany, they were
signalised for intrepidity, sagacity, and justice, and
the most noble ingenuousness of soul that knew not
what was deceit. They were faithful, hospitable,
and • so .elisistei that proititution of' females had
no place. The married held in the strictest ob-
servance the reverence (Inc to. the marriage vows,
and adultery, as well as 17ost,tiition, was unknown
among them. Polygamy was only tolerated in
tVeir most illustrious chiefi, some of whom took
two wives. All the nations of Germany were more
orless addiaed ttk ibriety, nor were the Batavians
too abstemious ; the spirit of gaming led them to
shocking excesses, arid not unfrequently, when every
other kind of -property, home, cattle, wife, and
offspring, were theirs no more, they set•their per-
sonal freedom as the last desperate stake, and went
into endless slavery, if the cast of the dice • proved
inauspicious. In the fellest . cold, hail,
.sleet; or
snow, the young Batavians went dressed in their
birth-day suits ! i.e. :Li naked . as they were born.
It was not till theydliad attained full maturity,' that
then wore the shaggy spoils, of the chace, which
they stained with a foreign die. This mantle they
flung carelessly over their shoulders, fastening it
roans the neck si•ith a clasp or buckle, or more fre-
quently with a thorn ; their legs, thighs, and arms
were left bare. The most illustrious or wealthy
were distinguished by a costume, not open and
flowing as taosc of the Parthians or Marmatians,
but so tight, and close, that all the lineaments of
the, form were visible. The dress of the femalts
scarcely varied in any rcspat prom. that of the
malei,exeepting that they wore a linen head-dress not
unlike a turban, adorned with purple colour ;And, (as
their fair descendants do at present) went with their
arms and ra:clt• entirely naked. Ile national co-
lour of their hair was a deep yellow, which they
wore plaited, and tied in a knot upon the crown,
leaving some locks, to • flow in graceful ringlets
on their shoulders. The men were c more vain
and proud of their • hair than 'the wontiii,. Gird
made use of lees and drugs to increase the .desirable
goldt.n tint. .The wanton and voluptuOus Romans
were pleased with their yellow locks, which by their
means became renowned for beauty, even in imperial
Rome. The adult males of the Batavians wore a
rap or hat neatly wove of twigt,fitting close to the
lead, with a very small rim, and 'their 'beards they
:wore in general long or bushy. Some of their prin.
;apt men wore enormously lirke whiskers, but
shaved off the 'other part of the beard; and some
-:again suffbred the beard on the upper 'lip tb grow
so long, that hanging over their mouth, it descended
to the breast, so drat when they ate or drank, the
food remained stitking to it, and their drink was
stained as through a sieve.
Their old warriors who had lost a friend in battle,_
let the hair grini till hik death 'was avenged ; the
young warriors let-then' locks and beard grow un-.
shorn till they had slain a foe in coirtbat. • They bad
neither fortified towns or cities-, prior. to the ar-
rival of the Romaits, nor knew they' of the art of
securing' the country from inundatibns, by dykes.
Their huts, builf of timber, and 'eciVeredwfth-teed•
or straw, were placed on small artificial emindnces,
called TerPen. or Torpen; not close tetgether, 'but
detached, and surrounded by a Wharf &Aim*. No
regular order of streets, &c. was reserved, but.
each one reared 'his- cabin eirt'tlie sp t which best.
pleased him: ' Of `costly furnitee they - ktt'in,rnot,
for upon the same floor slept the' citldiaih' "altd his
steed. Of what is generally Lande'rstood •133 t the
word learning, they had nothift f& neither high
nor low, rich nor poor, kiiik fife use or -letters.
The Romans who conquered civilized them, and
taught them to fortify their towns,- tb read and
write; and other useful arts. Thg Batavians were
very expert ler-se/nen, and greatly exe./fed in •siviin-
ming, and, in the hottest of titre ' figlit, 'phinged.
headlong into the most deep; breialli and 'rapid
streams, to cut off retreats, or brelaki the Order of •
the foe, by sadden, furious, and uneXpefed Onsets.
They made but seldom any use of Si twordirbattle,
but of a spear or javelin, which in close or distant
engagement they used with amazing rime' ity and
efit.ct-: those weapons were called Vaineen. The Ca-
valry, with a shield and a trameen •were. reckoned
fully armed: the shields were made Of osier, curiously
interwoven, of-an oblong shape, .painted and oina-
mentecl with rude representations of the heads of
beasts, arrows, lightnings, &c. Exclusive of those
weapons, the infantry made use' of spears, 'which
they handled' with great skill, and threw with rent
precision to ateazing distances. Few of the ltata-
Arians wore armour; same, however, had helmets
on in battle. -their greatest might lay in their in-
fantry ; -their-cavalry was neither beautiful nor fleet,
nor trained m eeolutions to make or shun a charge:
They rushed to the attack with an impetuosity that
was almost irresistible, and their leaders held their
line in order. In the midst of their battles • the
Batavians were animated by the shouts and shrieks
of their wives and children, who front afar beheld the
combat, and whose well-known cries in the moment
of need, smote theit hearts, and brought afresh to the
minds of thewattidts the dangers which awaited those
dearestepledges of their affection,..filled their sour:
with -new fury; and not unfrequentlyolecided their
dubious flight, and 4ed to viclory ansi. triumph. The
mothers anCtbe wives attended on, the wounded,
washed theirigory limbs,. sunt sucked with their lips
the venordinomthe wound, The women were also ac-
customed to StOp.the fugitives who were retreating
from the field, fuss! by tears and Teproaches send them
to renew the combatt for their families and freedom.
All domestic matters, and all that had cnkicern with
agriculture, was committed.to the women and aged
melt. Tbe food of the Batavians was simple as
possible. They eat wild apples, .milk, butter, and
cheese. They made a sort of ek pap (such as
in Ireland and Scotland is used by the poor people,
called StirAboot) of wild oats and barley., They
had tame cattle, which they slaughtered:for food,
and in the woods they chaced the wild beasts for

.•
the same use, and uml their hides for ma'rttlef.
They made a fermented drink from boiled barley,
which in taste and effeBs bore a great resemblance
to wine. To marry At an early age, was univer-
sally condemned by all the German tribes; lend it-
was deemed scandalous for a youth to shave had
conne&ion with a female ere his twentieth year was
completed, Long virginity was also esteemed in
the women. The lovers were matched together
agreeably to their age, size, &c. the most masettline
and gigantic females, with the largest limbed and
tallest of the males. The marriages were concluded
in the presence of the relations of each contra&ing
party : the marriage-portion was not gine by
the woman to the man, but by the bndcgtoom
to his bride. The gifts were not such as la-
dies are nlw best pleased with, neither tilks,
nor laces, nor precious jewels ; but the bride re-
ceived a couple of oxen, a trained horse, a sword, a
javelin, and a shield, and the bride presented to her
future Lord some warlike weapons, whereby the
contraft was confirmed.. 'These singular bridal
gifts were intended to remind the bride of hrer futtne
dutit"s, to share in the calm of peace, the tempests
of war, to participate iu all the fortunes of her
husband, to console him in atili6tion, and main-.
tain an eternal fidelity. It was esteemed-a great
disgrace for women, by any arts, to preunt the
hearing of children, or to murder the newly born,
for the sake of ineumbrances in wars, mi-
grations, &c. The mothers never-entrusted their
babes to suck any strange breasts, or committed the
care of their infants to wet nurses. Property seems
to have been in common with them. The Germans:
in general made use of but little ceremony in di:-
posing of their deid. The bodies of their most il-
lustrious chiefs were bdrnt on huge funeral pike,
and the arms and steed of the dead were sometiales•
cast into the flames. Grief hung heavy on their"
souls, their cries and loud *lamentations quickly.
ceased; but sorrow dwelt long in their hearts, and
cheirfulness and mirth returned but by very slow
degrees.

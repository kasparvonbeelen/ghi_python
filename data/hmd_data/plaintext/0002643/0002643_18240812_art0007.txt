LONDON, TIIL'RSDAY. AUGUST 12, 1824.

By the American Papers, which arrived yesterday, it ap-
pears that blaranham, Ceara, and the northern provinces
of Brazil, have withdrawn themselvts from the authority
of the Emperor Pedro. The whole country is described as
in a disquiet state, and we ►uspect that the recent proceed-
:lgs of the Emperor have been but ill adapted to conciliate
tl.e favour of the Brazilians. It will not in the least sur-

'prise us to hear, that his throne has been overturned, and
fiat the Emperor has sailed for Europe, to make the grand
tour with his brother Don Miguel. So vast a country as
Bra:-.1 can be held tog‘ther only by a political system of a
r:uch more liberal nature than Don Pedro seems willing to
coreede.

The last advices from Jamaica, ria New York, have
disappointed the expectations in which we had indulged as
t t:.e trlngnillization of the negroes. Not only was the
partial revolt of the slaves in the Hanover district not
oppressed, but, cm the 17th of June, the insurrection had
a 1 to several estate: in the parish of St. Mary's, and
symptoms of insubordination bad been m4:lifested at other
vlaces in the island. The alarm was so great among the
white inhabitants, that martial law had been proclaimed,

aed every measure of precaution resorted to, for the gene-
ra! safety. Some excesses had been committed by the in-
sergents, bt.t of what character, cc to what extent, we
are not hiformtd. We may, we fear, too truly anticipate,
that many atrocities bad marked the first successes of the
rete!s. All history bears witness to the horrors of every
beillm se, rile ; end the feelings of the colonists and their
revolted slaves are exasperated by that deep and almost in-
expressible hatred, arising from the difference of colour.
We are far from imputing to any of our countrymen, that
they regard these events butt with pain and anxiety. If
the spirit which unhappily seems to be excited among the
slave population in the West Indies cannot be suppressed;
if they cannot be elketually curbed while the measures
are brought it to operation for the amelioration of their con-
dition; if the mischievous delusions which have, somehow or I
other, been spread amongst them cannot be eradicated, we
are afraid that the ruin of our colonies must ensue, and the
hopes of the abolitionists themselves be 'Whaled. The
duty of raising the negro in the scale of society, by enlarg-
ing his knowledge and improving his morals, is fully ad-
mitted on all hands. It is nowhere pretended that slavery
ought to be perpetuated. The only question at issue is,
whether in this case the old adage may not hold gt al, vie.
" the more baste the wix se speed." All our sympathy is
not due exclusively to the negro. Some part of our bene-
volence ought to he reserved for those who belong to our
own blood. no we forward the interests of the slaves by
teaching them to look with jealousy and distrust upon those
to whom, after all, the work of their improvement must be

country. l'a an Irishman, England appears the high road to
riches and plenty—like IVhicitigton, he can almost believe the
streets of London are paved with gold, and he comes over with an
heroical determination to forsake for ever " pratees and butter-
milk," and play the very devil with the beef and porter. Nadia.

on Irish spirit and English breeding ; we are all ready to admit the,

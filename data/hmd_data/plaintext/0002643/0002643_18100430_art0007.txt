BADAJOS. APRIL 6.

The brave inhabitants of the valley of Afro aut.
taio the struggle with the greatest glory. The
-French hair not yet gained an inch of groUnd
there, but every day lose a considerable numht r of
sumo iu their attempts. They were lately required
to surrender, but their answer was that they pre-
ferred death to French slavery. The enemy, irri-
tated at this answer, attacked with the fury which
is naturel to them*, but were,shamefully repulsed,
with considerable loss: and the iuhabitants of the
valley, entering the French territory, sacked and
burned three nr four villages carrying off u quao-
thi)• of cattle.--(Badajos Diary, April 6.)

LISBON. APRIL hi.

By letters from Cadiz we learn, that the most
Excellent Sesser the Duke of Albuquerque is ap-
pointed Ambassador Extraordinary to His Britan-
nia Majesty. and that General Blake will take the
cousmaisd of his army ; General Lacy taking the
com ma's! of that of Blake. Lateraccounta affirm,
that the celebrated Castrum will take that eons-

'f;ie division of the enemy, underlteznier, occu-
pies the same position as before. Au Eog ex-
pedition, which Ives preraring for the coasts of
Catalonia, appears to have already arrived et that
principality. The enemy, who occupied the pro-
vitice of Fstreinadura, have taken, it is thought, the
direction of Andalusia. The division of Vegnier
pot itself in motion on the sth instant. for Comity-
naria and (;strew. lloey evacuating, on that day,
the towns of Garcons. Villa Gansula, and Afetiel-
lim. The advanced guards of O'Donnell are
ftillowlog the enemy. A etrjeant of humors of
Oman,* of Albuquerque has certified that be
killed a Lieutenant of French dragoons on the
laidge of Medellin.
Akiierul castanos has taken the command of the
krusy of thr isle of Litou.—( Lisboa Gas. April 12.)

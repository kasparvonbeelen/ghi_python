Ti.is is shat his Imperial• Majesty was bound
to do ; this is what he has done.
Since the year 1812, more than one Diplomatic
Document attests the generous solicitude which
the several Courts of Europe have constantly ma.
F rifened in behalf of Spain. They applauded the
noble perseverance with which her intrepid people
resisted. a foreign yoke. They rendered homage to

The Allied Sovereigns dill more. In the course
of long-conferences, relative to the differences with
Rio de lit Plata, aim! 'to the pacification of the CO.
loaies, they let, it be sufficiently understood, that
these institutions 'would 'cease to be a means of
peace and happiness, if, instead of being greeted
by kindness, as • - voluntary concession, they
should be adopted by weakness; as a last resource
of salvation. • • • • •

•I'lte'obligetion of the Ntiraisichs was, the fore,
and theirdesign was. to prevent that, bursting from
the same horizon, the same storm should a'third.
time desolate Europe. •
Nevertheless, as if the alarms which were then
excited by the state of France, and which it still
excites, were not sufficient—as if gwvernasentrimet,
tuitions entertained but slight doubts With,respeill"
to its future-condition, it • was necessary that the

genius Of evil should select a new theatre, and that
Spain, in lierivtrn, should be offered up as a fearful
sacrifice. Revolution has therefore changed its
ground, but the: duties of Monarchs cannot have
changed • their nature, and the power of insurrec-
tion is neither less .formidable, nor less dangerous,
than it would have been in France.
In unison, therefore, with his Allies, his Majesty
cannot ,but desire 'to see granted to the Peninsula,
as to its Trans-marine Provinces, a government
which he considers as the only one that can justify
some hope in this age of calamities. But rn virtue
of his engagements of the (3.1). 15th of November, '
1818, his Majesty is bound to-Mark, with the most
forcible. reprobation, the revolutionary measurer
set'in action to give new •institntious to Spain.—
Such is the Ciro-fold idea which is found developed
in the annexed answer, which „the Cabinet of Russia
has made to the Chevalier de Zee, by order of his
Imperial Majesty°. The Emperor does not doubt
that his august Allies will approve its contents,
and perhaps they have already addressed similar

sentiments to the Court of Madrid. The same
wishes may, in fact, have inspired the same lan-
guage, and'convinced, like his, Majesty, that 'crime
must always yield persticioUi fruit, they have,
• doubtless, deplored, as lie has, the outrage which

im.lr rem the Reports presented to the'Cortes by the
„moral Mibisteri of Spitioin their reitiiecti ve ilepart-
• shots; It k very evident that the Monarchy had
sunk under the old institutions into a state of the
utmost debility and contempt. The Government
was without resources or credit, and overwhelmed
with debts—the fineoces were to confnaion.and em-
barrassnient—the army was without pay, orate, or
clothiug--the navy hod 'lmo% certeed to cant—the
Peniosola was without trade, commerce. or indus-
''try—tlie provinces beyond ma hideither effected
their independence, or were in a state of open
.4stance to the Mother Country—and the people
q{„ dame were
..disgusted and discontented. The
necessity of a revolution was felt by the most
_enlightened men in Spain, and during some years
attempts were repeatedly made to accomplish this
object ; but circumstances defeated the
,
,several projects, and many valuable lives-were sacri-
ficed to the vengeance of the Kinn. The ineteas-
iug
embarrassments of the country at length roused
the nation effiCiOslly frtim its lethargy ; the public
feeling was communicated to She hoops ; and ro
feeble was the Government, so alight its hold
upqn the affections of the people, that the open
defection of one portion of the army, acting merely
upon_tkdefensive, reduced it to the necessity of
surrendering at discretion. This fact alone, inde-
, _pendent of the exultation displayed throughout the
Peninsula at the acceptance of the Consti-
tution, would sufficiently prove that the revolution
ion in accordance with the wishes of at least the
.great majority of the Spanish people. There was
here so civil war to exam the angry paswoos of the
.people, or develope their military energies to the
,alarm of other nations; there was no conflict of
political opinions to give birth to theories. of
.wernment, at once dangerous and impracticable.
The Constitution of the Cones had been formed
previously, was known and ritognieed by the
people, pas the object for which they thconutered

defended, . eaters .Ihedetail helougiog
to the execution. The only objection to theme
worki, that Lam aware of, is their expense and their
extent; with regard to the first, it must be remem-
bered, that the Isthmus is a frontlet, that a frontier
must be fortified, and that fortifieations cannot be
constructed without Resist cost; het when we con-
sider the importance of the plebe, that. squared
stones are on the spot, that fiat qUarrierve un tte.
spot, that labour is cheap in Gresee, Metals twit/
would be employed, which would+. labour with the
enthhsiastn of men who struggle nr freedom, and
mho feel they are working for their lives ; and that
fine forests are at hand to furnish timber, which
.would cost nothing but the labor of Idling it-
when these matter. are considered. 1 maintain tip*
the cost will be comparatively-mein& 404
lively very trifling, end the posittee expense is, is
the present state of Ohms, the important considera-
tion ; in fact, there is nothing to pay for hut labour,
and those who labour would be content to do so far
food, of which a Greek is satisfied with very little.
It is justice to the unhappy Greeki to say, that is
such a cause, man, worn in, and child, would la-
bour without any reward: they have fixed their
longing eyes upon freedom, and if they were put to
the work the fortifications %could rice like magic, by
the force of their enthusiastic patriotism. Never
were works raised with less money, or in less time,
than those would be. They who have never bees
slaves do Dot at first form a correct idea of what
slaves can do who labour for liberty. We calm•
late by the steady progress of a persevering Eng-
lishman, who would do the work of ten Greeks in
the general course of labour ; but rocks and earth
would fly like chaff under the strokes of the Greeks,
when labouring against the Turks, and seeing a pe-
riod to their slavery in the completion of theic work.
The next objection is to the extent of fortifica-
tions, which demand so large • garrison. 1 think a
fair view of the subject will remove this.

The first line would consist of fortified positions li
in Mount Geranion, and the extent trifling; this
them we pass over.
The second is the shortest line across the Isar.'"
mus, sod would not require a garrison *bile the
fortified position of Mount Ger•oion was main.
Mined ; but if that was abandoned, the same troops
would easily furnish u garrison to defend • line of
rampart only three and a I►alf miles in length.
Lastly. if driven from this, to the third line, still
the army would not have the whole length to line
with troops, se nearly the whole length of the rocky
ridge, and great part of the Acrocorinthus bring
scarped, would require nothing but a chain of sen-
tinels, being too steep and high for escalade.
Thus the defence would be reduced t• a remit of
about the same length as that of the second line,
and the garrison may be estimated at 15,000 men.
This shows, that in case of emergency, a small
force could secure the post; but I by no means
allow that it can ever be placed upon the footing
of com►uon garrisons; I assert, that a whole people
will defend it, and therefore that the extent of its
works will signify nothing. The Isthmus. of
midi is a frontier, and a frontier of less than four
miles ought to present ►:o point of weakness, and
defy all approch, but by regular siege.
The garrison of Corinth ought to be the army
of Greece, and every defensive position between
the Danube and Mount Geraniun ought to be
considered as an out-work ; for I think, in rase of
reverses, the best line of retreat for the Greek
army, at all times, and whether from the attack of
Austria, Russia, or Turkey, will be on tl►e
Isthmus of Corinth. If Greece be master of Asia
Minor, Corinth end the capital would both become
bases on which to retreat, because the strength of
the army would enable it safely to be divided, each
division carrying on the war as a distinct nation,
but under one general-in-chief. The enemy would
find it • vast undertaking to carry on two such
sieges at once; the force of Asia Minor pouring
into the defence of Constantinople, and the king.
dour of the Moren feeding that of the Isthmus;
yet if he did not besiege both at once, is greet
army would sally forth from the one, and produce
a diversion in favour of the other. I may add a
third place of great importance, called the Dards-
rielles of Lepanto, which should be fortified; these
twrecapes. commanding the entrance of the Gulf
of Corinth, are not so essential on this account. as
that they would enable the army retreating to the
Isthmus to detach a force into Albania to defend
the poises of that country, secure the left flank of
the retreating army. sod hang on the right of the
enemy : now if this corps had not a secure place of
embarkation at Lepanto, it would either tisk being
cut off, or be unable to act with effect against the
enemy, who would have a shorter line of march to
the Isthmus.

It is to be observed, that as the communication '
between Constantinople, the Isthmus, and the
Dardanelles of Lepanto, would remain open by sea,
the limos of the army could he collected on any
one of those points, provided that the fleet of the
Greeks was superior, which it would probably be,
to that of either Austria, or Russia; and in all
future ware, supposing succers to attend the pre-
sent striggle,Greece would probably have Etiglaad
or France so alliance with her; for whether Russia
attempts to extend her territory in Asia or Europe,
she would be opposed by England or Frstioe; and
Greece would be close on her flank, supported by
one or both of these empires. Russia and Greece
will never be allies, because the former will not
willingly allow her fleets to be locked up in the
Black Sea, and certainly endeavour to make her-
self a naval p.►wer by the conquest of Greece. In
endeavouring to show how trifling would be the ex-
tent of the fortiticstions I propose, compared tee'
the numbers who would be in arms for their de-
fence, I have insensibly been drawn into a digres-
sion, shearing their importance to Greece in this and

my principle, .. point

eastern frontier, and on which the corps of the
!At, destined to defend Constantinople, would
rehire ; there can therelose be no doubt, I think,
of two thimp
• lat. That GreecAnd Asia Minor would furpisk
a larger force than could act in one mass, and lhal
half such mass, if forced to retreat, would tarnish
troops enough to garrison mach inner extensive
works than I have proposed for Corinth, and have

the army of the latter ought to retire to Ceriatb3
and tnerrly throw a garrison into the capital.

As the Greek has now neither Asia Minor nor
Constuntinople, the Isthmus is of more import-
ance, and will render the Morro as asvlum for all
who • fly from Turkish vengeance; iuJeed, if the
Greeks would abandon the rest of Greece at once,
and colonize w the Peninsula, even before any for-
tification but the simple wall should be thrown 1'

the Turks fur more effectually than in their pre..l

they could iu a week construct a work across the:
Isthmus, and defend it with pikes against the at-i
tack of the whole Turkish army. A p.rpolatio•'
thus concentrated, nod rendered desperate by the
conviction, that either extermination or victory is
their alternative, would also produce certain sums.
of money in taxes, which, however small, would be
of great service.

LISBON, OCTOBER 21.
CORTES, Or:Tonga 21.
In this sitting a project of a Decree, proposed
by the Committee of Public Instruction, was read,
to enact that a copy of every book primed in the
kingdom shall be deposited in the public library,
periodicals are included, but they need only be
delivered every three months.
To be read a second time.
M. Borges Carneiro made a proposition for abo-
lishing the Order of the Knights of Malta, which
he prefaced by a long speech on the happiness of
countries whose inhabitants consist of productive
classes, that is, such as subsist by agriculture,
commerce, or manufactures. contrasted to the
misery of a nation where a great part of the people
live by public employments or ecclesiastical bene-
fices, that is, at the expense of the productive classes.
Such where they are numerous, do nothing, Or no-
thing useful, or what is only a vexation to their
fellow-citizens : " I call them drones, legal va-
grants, swarms of troublesome flies. Aral what
shall I say of those who live on commanderies,
akaidarius, and other favours graciouvly conferred ?
I call those things legal robberies and sanctified
idleness." The orator quoted Switzerland and the
United States of North America us u contrast :
proposing that all such useless burdens should
be diminished, and that the Cortes should begin
with the Order of Malta and the Corutnanderies
belonging to it. The orator fully recognised the
utility of the Order when first established, for the
purpose of attending to the hospital at Jerusalem,
and the valour with which the Knights had sub-
sequently combated the Mussehnen. But all is
changed ; there is no hospital at Jerusalem, nor pil-
grimages to the Iluly bind ; our do we now judge it
conformable with the stirit of Christianity to coin-
' bat the believers in the Koran with arms. We have
a regular army and navy to defend ourselves against
the attacks of other Powers, whatever be their faith,
and from pirates. It is not necessary to mix up
these things with religion, which consists in prayer,
patience, and doctrine. Tlie Order of Malta was
in fact abolished by the occupation of the island,
first by the French, and afterwards by the English;
and though the re-establishment of it was mention-
ed in the basis of the Treaty of Amiens. yet the
Treaty of Parts decided to the contrary. He there-
fore moved—
l. the Order of St. John of Jerusalem be abolished
in Portugal, as in the rest of Europe.
2. That the Commauderies shall remain to the present
holders fur their life, and then be applied to the payment of
the national debt.

To be read a second time in another sitting.
In the same sitting the second reading was conti-
nued of the opinion of the Ecclepiastical Committee,
respecting certain cases in which it would be requi-
site to apply to Rome. A very great debate arose
on the first article, which was relative to the appli-
cation to the Pope for u bull to suppress certain
convents. Many members were of opinion that no
application was necessary, and that the Cortes were
competent to proceed to such measures of reform
without any bull. Other. thought that, even al-
lowing the civil power to hove the right, it w 44,

The wishes of all good citizens have been talfilletl.
The arrest of several persons in the night of 1;:e
4th instant, on account of certain plans of. colt-
'piracy, has been proved to be the result of a de-
testable calumny. The persons arrested were set
■t liberty on the evening of the 40111, and the in-
famous Domingo Albelariejo is arrested. He is
the same person who informed against some of the
militia, who were arrested at the end of June, anti
set at liberty at the end of July. It is a pity that
there is no legal proof who employed this wretch,
that they may receive the punishment they merit.

Vere it not for the wise precautions that have
been taken on account of the fears enterta►ned
that the contagion hsd appeared in Triana, we
should be ignorant that there eai•ted any disorder
that could inspire alarm ; but we are certain that we
have nothing to fear, as sell on account of the pre-
cautions that are taken, as because the sicknemt
which has manifested itself at Triana is dimi-

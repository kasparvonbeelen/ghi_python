THE BETSEY SCHOONER.

On the 10th November, 1805,the Raley schooner,
burden about 75 ions, lett Macau, bound for New
South Wales; the crew consisted of William Brooks,
Commander ; Edward Luttrell, mate ; one Portu-
guese gunner, three Portuguese seacunnies, three
Manilla and four Chinese Lascars. From the 10th
November to the 10th, nothing particular happen-
ed; but on the 21st, at half-past two, a. w. the vet.
tel struck upon a reef, going 71 knots; instantly
lowered down the boat, and sent a small anchor
astern, but on heaving, parted with the cable: they
then began to snake a raft of the water casks, but
the swell was so great it was impossible to tilled it ;
at day-break found the vessel had forged upon the
reef foot or five miles, not having more than two
feet water; the reef extending to the S. 9 or 10
miles, E. and W. 4 or 5. During three days and
nights every, exertion was used to get her off. but
to no effea, and the crew were so weakened.
that they could hardly be persuaded to con: teat a
raft, the vessel, at this time, being bilged on the
starboard side. On the 24th, made a raft, and left
the vessel, the jolly boat in company, steering for
Balarnhangan ; Capt. Brooks, the mate, gunner,
and two seacunnies, were in the jolly boat, provided
only w;th six bottles of water, and a small bag of
buiscuit ; on the raft were ooe Portuguese, four
Chinese, and three Malays, much beVer provided;
they parted company the same day, it coming on to
blow a brisk gale from the N.W. and tha raft was
seen no noire. As the island of Borneo bore SE.
there is a probability of its having drifted upon fit.
From the 24th, until the 2dtli, it continued blowing
hard from the N.W. with a mountainous sea, and
then fell calm; the water was, by this time, entirely
expended. and the remainder of the biscuit wet with
salt water. At day break, on the 29th, saw land, which
they supposed to be Balabac, the people neatly ex-
hausted with pulling, it being a periled calm, and
under a burning sun, added to which, they were
obliged to drink their own urine. At night, it blew
so hard from the N.E. that they were obliged to
bear up for Banguey, the north west point of
which they discovered at day light neat morn-
ing, and instantly watt in &circa of water, whici
they soon discovered. and drank to excess.—

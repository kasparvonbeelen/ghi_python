' Greeks with his own demands ; asserted that the Ports
had fulfilled its Treaties respecting Moldavia and Wal-
lachia, since 3,000 police guards cannot be called a
military occupation; a.id that the Porte consequently
hoped that Russia, on its part, would no longer dell
to give op to the Tut ks the fortresses of Bessarabia, the
restitution of which was capitulated by the peace of 1812.
The French Journals add, that when this answer is knownut St.
Petersburgh, it is not doubted but that it will lead to an order to

orders tbit the fortresses on the Danube should be provisioned for
six months.

Last night, Mr. BROUGHAM brought forward his mo-
tion on the subject of Colonial Slavery, and, in a speech
of nearly three hours in length, contended that the Co-
lonial Legislatures had in fact done nothing towards
ameliorating the condition of the slaves. The Learned
Genth man concluded with mo7ing a Resolution, de-
claratory of the regret of the House, that the measures
recommended by Parliament for ameliorating the con-
dition of the nrgroes had not bail attended to; and
pledging the House, that if something were not dnue

next Ses%ion, with a view of adooting such measure; as
m iy appear necessary to give effect to its le,o!utions.

Mr. Wit.uor- Hoarse and Mr. Secretary CANNI►G chewed that
the resolution was preniatere and unnecessary, and contended with
great ability that the best means of obtaining the object they all bad
in view, the mitigation and ultimate extinction of negro slavery,
was by temperate and conciliatory measures. On a division, Mr.
&ottoman's motion was negatived, by a majority of 100 to 30.

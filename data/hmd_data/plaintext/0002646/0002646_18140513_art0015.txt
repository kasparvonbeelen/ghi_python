gations of this Treaty. These obligations were, not..
withstanding their revolting nature; he would

lion indeed, her rightt over the sovereignty of Nor-
way ; but the Norwegians theantelvet, rightly, as the ,
Chancellor, of the . Exchequer had said,. refused to
sanction this transfer ; they had, as they were entitled
to do, resisted theoppres,icui with 'which they were
threatened; and. although they were justly so resist-

the British arms, he contended, lajd.tiot been stipulated
for, and consequently ought: not' 30 be permitted.-
-It had been said; .that. this 'was, an illusory con-
struction of the Treaty. amd.• It wastontended, that
we were bound to see Norway annexed to Sweden.-
As tar as the cessind of the sovereignty of Denmark ,
could go, that annexation bad been accomplished,
and not one step further was this country bound to gO.
The King. of Denmark had ceded his sovereignty,
had ceded his rights over Norway, and; at far as he

to this spirit of resistance ; and it had been further
insinuated, that the Danish Goveininent ahemseives
had, in an :ornderhand mime; given encourage-
ment to the feelings which had been displayed.-1
If this had been the 'case, let Prince Cristian be
punished-let Denmark be again visited. by the ra-
vages of war, but there was no principle:of-jos.
tine or humanity, which could bind this- country
to perform towards Norway, an act of national injus.

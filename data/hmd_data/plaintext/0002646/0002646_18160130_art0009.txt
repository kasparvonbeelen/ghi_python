PARIS, JANUARY 26.

Since the three English Officers have been in the
prison of La Force, we see every day before that pri.
son a great number ot carriages belonging to their
countrymen, who come to visit them. The men
alone are admitted to the prisoners : the ladies remain
in the carriages.
M. Cambac2res is not going to Italy : none of the
individuals comprised in the Royal Ordinance can go
thither. The only countries where they can find an
asylum are Prussia, Austria, and Russia. M. CAIn.
baceres has asked leave to repair to Prussia.
A letter from Amiens, of the 22d, says —" We
hi,ve had these three days a regiment of the 'English
Guards: they are from the environs of Paris, and art.:
i;oing to the coast. The officers highly condemn the
three Englishmen who favoured the escape of Lava-
tette, and seem to desire that they should be punished."
The Maids Mercury, which began to assume the
tone of the 11'a:a Jam, has just been supp:i;ssecl,
the EJitor, M. Genres, arrestzd.
The posts occupied by the Nationll Guards and
the triiops of the line, have been considzrab.y aug-
mented for soave says.
M. the Duke of Rohan, first Gentleman of the
Chaeiher, gave this evening a fete, on the occasion ot
the Antr*aersary of the Birth-41- et the Duke of
Berri. The Duke of Wellington was present, and
great number of foreigneri ot distinction. •

Lieutenant General Rapp is arrived at Paris.
The Ex-King of Sweden, Gustavus IV. arrived
about the beginning of December at'Prevesa, on the
coast of Albania, on his way from Corfu. He was
received by the Vizier, Ali Pasha, with every kind of
honour, and with demonstrations of the most lively
cordiality. It is said that this Prince will proceed to
Grannina, by the route of Arta.

CHAMBER 011 DEPUTIES.
SECRET COMMITTER OF THE JANUARY.
The Chamber continued the discussion on the ire-
portconcerning Donations to the Clergy.
The additional article proposed by M. Cardennel,
tending to apply to the Clergy the ecclesiastical pro-
perty found in the hands of some patriots, who may
have evidently got possession of it, is equally adopted.
The Chamber now voted upon the whole law.
189 were for it, and 11S against it.
CASSEL. JANUARY 20.
The differences between Austria and Bavaria ap.
pear to be very serious. The Bavarian Government
has publicly received the solemn deputations of the
Circles of the Inn and the Saltach, which were sent
to declare that the inhabitants of those Provinces will
risk every thing rather than be separated from the
Bavarian. Monarchy, whose enlightened and generous
system assures to them the maintenance of their
rights and the
.growth of their prosperity. Bavaria
has also permitted 'the publication of a Paper, en-
titled, 44 The One or the Other," in which the Bava•
rians are openly instigated to resist by main force the
pretensions of Austria.
• The author says, " the independence and existence
of Bavaria may be menaced in two ways. It may be
attacked by Austria and by Prussia singly, or it may
be attacked by both these Poweri at the same time.
In either case, it is to be recollected that Bavaria
possesses an excellent army of from 60 to 70,00 Q
men, without reckoning the Landwebr, which may
also furnish excellent soldiers.
4, Bavaria, if attacked by Prussia, ought to form
an alliance with Austria—attacked by Austria, she
ought to ally herself to Prussia. in the first case she
would seek to aggraturtse herself towards the North,
facilitating to Austria new acquisitions in the South.
In the second case she would endeavour to aggro:dm
herself towards the South, aiding Prussia in the ac-
quisition of new Provinces on the ()der and the Rhine.
Such an alliance would not be a common approxima-
tion, but a union for hjfemiddeath.
In the case of Bavaria being attacked by the Prus-
sians and Austrians in concert, she would invoke the
support of Russia lad England. Assuredly she would
not call for that s in vain, But evea supposing
that this aid be ,SIOW in arriving, she would

MARTYRDOM Of KING CSARLIII I.—Holiday at the Bet&

We.this day received the Paris Papers of Satur.
day, from which we subjoin extracts. Our Readers
will see that the National Guards of Caen have been
disbanded, and a new organization ordered. We pre-
some this measure Las been rendered necessary in
consequence of symptoms of disaffection having
brakes out.
The French Bishops whored at BCDTAPARTeS
famous Concordat, and took refuge t London a few
years since, have been restored to their Bishoprics.
Those, oa the contrary, who subscribed to that instru-
meet, have “ generously given in their resignation."
In other words, they have been dismissed.
The Minima,. announces, that from and after the
Ist of February nest, the Gazelle °Aiello will cease,
and the columns of the libeling. will be devoted to
all official communications, as before. Those articles

which are strictly official are to be distinguished by a
peculiar type.

PARIS, JANUARY 17.
To-morrow (Saturday) a grand review will take
place on the Carrousel. It will consist of at least
10,000 men of the Royal Guards of all arms, of
whom 3,500 are cavalry. Oa the 11th February two
battalions of the Nationgl Guards of Paris will also
be reviewed.

JANUARY 111.
Madame Lavalette now resides in tranquillity in
her house, Rue de Grenelle St. Germain.
The Ambassador Irons the King of Sardinia
arrived yesterday at Paris.
M. de luatenay, attached to the French Legation
at Rome, has also arrived at Paris, with dispatcl es
Irom our. Ambassador.

M. I)elarus has been appointed French Consul at
Trieste.

M. Sieyes •arrived at Brussels on the 21st.
They write from Caen, 24th January :—.41 Yester.
day a Decree was posted from Count Bertier, 'Prefect
of the CAlvados; which states, that the 'stational
Guirds of Caen are dissolved, and that they will be
immediately reorganised. This Decree also po►n►s
out the mode of re.organiution."

The six English soldiers accused of being the au-
thors of the assassination committed lately on the

carriers, near Luzarches,.have been arrested.
It will. be recollected, that at the date of the last
Concordlt, several Bishops of the Gallican Church,
then emigrants in England, addressed a letter to the
Pope as firm as it was respectful, in w`tich they gave
as the reason of their refusal to resign their Bishop-
ticks, the fear of appearing by this deference to the
intentions c$ his Holiness, to recognize the Usurper,
and thus break the ties of fidelity by which they were
attached to the legitimate sovereign. The letter of
these prelates was drawn up by M. Asseline, Bishop
of Boulogne, one of the ancient Doctors of the Sor-
bonne : the cause no longer existing, we are assured
that those of the Fgench Bishops who bad hitherto
preserved their places have generously renounced
thesis, with the view of accelera,ting the conclusion of
the'negociations begun last year betvseen the Court
of France and that of Rome, and thus to concur in
founding the peace of the Church on new bases which
the force of circumstances and the wisdom of the
two Powers are on the eve of establishing.

COURIZR FATRAORDINART OF SATURDAY MORNING.

NAPLES, JANUARY 9.
His Majesty, by an Edict of the 7th, has suppress:
ed the central houses of detention and the suociusals,
established in the provinces and harbours of the
kingdom. Since the restoration of order these esta.
blishosents have become expensive and useless.

created Houses of Charity for young girls, and has
abolished mendicity. The sons of soldiers, or of the

PARMA, OCTOBER Is.

Two Englishmen have been here, some time, and
have investigated with great attention our monuments
of the Arts, our Museums, and our Libraries ; they
visited the ruins of. Velleia, and in assisting at the
works, discovered an elegant
.bas-relief which was
Placed over a fountain. It represents the two brothers
Cacor and Pollux. This bat-relief, which the cele-
brated antiquary, M. de Lama, who is appointed to
superintend the extrication of the ruins, believes to be,
Grecian, is in the best taite.• It consists of four
figures, and the attitude of Castor is admirable, bay-
ing all. the grace of *the antique. These learned
Englishmen have had several conversations with
Abbe Derussi, one of.the must learned menial the

lis'ed at Montreal about 150 disbanded foreiassolis
of Do Meuron's Regiment, whom he equitialvd
alms and uniform, as if going on regular shay

THE GRAND REVIEW.
CAMBRAY, Oevoszn23. —The review and the grated
manosuvres took place yesterday in the plain of De-
nain. The ground 'Was so soaked with the torrents
of rain which *fell dining the two preceding days,
that it was thought scarcely possible to defile the
army. The Dukes of !CENT and CAMBRIDGB were
received by the Duke of WaLLINCITON at the head of
the troops, who) continued to mancelivre until live
in the evening. Atte:. a grand dinner given by the
Duke Of WELLINGTON, there was a ball, at which the
two English Princes, remarkable for their affability,
were seen surrounded by the principal officers of the.
armies of occupation, and the most distinguished
ladies of their nations. The ball was suspended at
midnight by a supper, for which a table of GO covers
was laid. The dancing was afterwards resumed,
and continued until tltri.e in the morning. At siz
the Doke at KZNT let out for Brussels, and the Doke

character of Britons for a hatred of tyranny and
cruelty, and a love of justice, remains as great as

sentiment on this most momentous question ; and
resolutions adopting for presenting respectful petitions
to Parliament, praying that the guilt of reviving this
abominable and wicked commerce may be averted
from this free and happy country. There is ne time
to be lost. Those parishes which may not yet have
called meetings to concur in the exertions of the ene-
mies of slavery, should instantly express their abhor-
rence of such a diabolical traffic.

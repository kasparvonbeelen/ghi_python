LYCEUM.—Friday, Mr. BATLEY commenced his
Course of Lectures on Astronomy. It was partly read and partly
recited by Mr. Baanac, with sufficient but tempered force. The
transparent Orrery, Signs of the Zodiac, Exhibitions of tbe Phe-
nomena of several Comets, Ste. and the whole of the machinery, are
very complete and beautiful. Some occasional strains of the Cele&
tins gave additional relief to the subject ; and we very much suspect
that a little more of this kind would not be unacceptable. 'rho
Lecture went offvery well, and seemed to give general satisfaction.
HEATRIL—Friday night. a Gentleman of
the name of Haase gave au entertainment at this House, which is
to be continued, in the usual course, on the blank play nights during
Lent. The Brat part of the affair ounsisted of a Lecture after the
manner of Mr. Marnews. The evening cotteluded with-in erbi-
Ibition of the Phantasoisgurla; and the House, upon the whole, was

Voluptuous transports in the bosom : then
The place around appears a Paradise,
Where Angels visit, and abide with Alen!
Sech is the pow'r of Nature: yet there are--
As every heart can testify, I ween—
Objects more sweet and beautiful by far
Than all that gladdens in the fairest scene !
The hue of youth, the gracefulness of form,
Th, melody of voice, the heaven of eye,
The balmy breath, the every nanseleu charm
That gives to Woman het supremacy !
Oh! these are they that over every soul
Come with enduring influence; that bind
In silken slavery, in soft controul,
The hopes and destiny of every mind!

STANZAS.
There is a sweetneuin the breath of Meru,
There is a beauty in the fall of Even,
There is a rapture in the music bum
Dy Lark rejoicing up the mit et Hems ! •
In summer days to see the imenibilmns
And catch the fragrance which the wild Sevelredigilei:
Tote y along the turf, and bear the hum
Of insects sporting in the sunbeams' glow !
Or on the shady side of same green hill
To look upon ensue valley, stretched away,
Through whose rich bosom winds a wanton rill,
Aod o'er whose pastures docks innumerous stray !
All this is beautiful.; and if the while
Upoti the ear the notes of music die,
[daunted by distant shepherds, who beguile
The livelong hours with rural minstrelsy !
Then does the soul feel ravishment : arise

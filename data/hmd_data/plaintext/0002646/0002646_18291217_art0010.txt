This morning despatches were received at the Foreign
Office from their Excellencies Lord STUART DE Rorn-
SAY, our Ambassador at the Court of France ; and
from Sir CHARLES BAGOTT, our Ambassador at the
Hague.

We are glad to announce that the Meeting of the
Merchants interested in the South American Trade,
alluded to some days ago in our Paper, has this day
taken place ; that an Association has been formed, and'a
Committee appointed to. frame the regulations for its
future guidance.

There WAS an article in the Courier of Tuesday, written
in a spirit of disingenuousness and detraction, with re-
ference to the abolition of slavery in Mexico, which '
ought not to go uncontradicted. The writer says : " were
there any considerable number of labourers held in pro-
perty in Mexico, it would have been incumbent on the
Government, before passing such an Act, to have pro-
vided for the indemnity of the owners." If the Courier
were really as ignorant of this fact—as he affects to be—
we could inform him that there are large slave estates in
Mexico, notwithstanding the pre-disposition from climate
to a life of ease, on which theoretical refinement he bases
his denial of their existence. As to the indemnity of
which he speaks, our uncandid contemporary knows that
such " indemnity" s made a condition in the DECRAZ of
the Executive, but. contingent on the finances of the Go-
vernment. Such misrepresentations are as despicable as
they are mischievous.

As we fully anticipated, the negotiation with MM
ROT and CHABIOL to patch up the POLIGNAC Mi-
nistry, has been broken off : for it seems that the
whole of those to whom overtures were made, have been
attacked by the Gazette de France. The Constitutionnet
of Monday, contains an article on the state of the
Ministry, which will be found in another column, and
deserves particular attention. The concluding paragraph
touches with great force on a subject which we treated at
some length a few days age,—namely, the probable, or
rather inevitable effects of foreign intervention. From
what we have already said on this subject, it is needless
to add how entirely we coincide with all the sentiments of
the writer. Having so frequently warned CHARLES
X., and those by whom he is now surrounded, of the
fatal consquences which must result from a perseverance
in their present course, we are highly gratified to per-
ceive the moderate tone and temper with which all the
points at issue are discussed by the liberal Press. Nothing
could be better calculated to furnish at once a reply to
the detractors of rational freedom, end attain the great
objects in view. Whatever its results may be,
the pending contest in France is detiply interest-
ing to every country in Europe. It would, indeed,
be a very confined view of the matter, not
to feel that the friends of freedom in Franco are eon-

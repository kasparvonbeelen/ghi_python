ADDRESS OF THE CITIZENS OF GHENT.

" GENERALâ€”The happy result of the efforts of the
Allies have been the emancipation from slavery of
the greater part of Europe, and although it has been
the fate of the city of Ghent, not at so early a period
as some others, t. feel the happy effects of the mea-
sures adopted for the freedom of mankind, the inha-
bitants are not on that account the less rejoiced at this
constunmation.
" If by the tyrannical conduct of the French Go-
vernment the once wealthy city of Ghent has beep
reduced to poverty, the people who dwell there are
far from repining at their lot, in which so many mil-
lions have parCcipated ; and their sufferings will tend
to instruct them how highly they ought to appreciate
their liberation.

We have been deputed by our Fellow Citizens to
deposit in your hands the keys of Ghent, and we do
so with the per'ect assurance that you will watch
over our interests, and secure us from the vengeance
of our common enemy. The sentiments of patriotism
we-would express are not felt only by ourselves, but
by the entire population of the province to which we
belong. The detestation of the French is only equalled
by the love we bear to our deliverers, and whatever
torte may be employed by the enemy to reduce our
city, shall be received with that spirit which presump-
tion and injustice should excite."

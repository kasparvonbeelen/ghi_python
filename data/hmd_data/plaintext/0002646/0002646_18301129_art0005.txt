This Nobleman was born in the year 1770, and is descended from a
respectable Cumberland family, who. 60 or 70 years ago, first settled
in Westmorland, fn Oita is situated Brougham Hall (in the parish
of Brougham), called 6y a celebrated tourist " the Winds* of the
North." His mother was the sister of Professor Robinson, the his-
toffee, and ts ;ern in the enjoyment of a green old age. He has three
brothers—Jan:es, John, and William. The former resides with his
mother at the hall; he is in Parliament. The tatter is at the bar.
John was many years a wine-merchant at Edinburgh, who's he lately
failed. The Learned lard first took his •at in the Commons for
Camelfoed, haeigt bess returned by the Dake Bedfeed ;he subse-
quently sat for under the 'lsaiah of Cleveland; then fur
Enaresborough ; lastly, as we all know, for Ye:Lida. In early I:fe
he was an admirer of Mr. Pitt; but lived long atom& to declare him-
self ambitious of being known to posterity_ as that statesman's greatest
enemy—politically of amuse. In lady Ws, toe, he mate a work on
colonial policy, in whip he held the doctrine that the African was so
infator to the European as scarcely to belong to the same species ; but
he lived to manna himself the a:simples of that injured race, and
the advocate et the instant abolition of colonial slavery. His contests
for Westmorland—his unsurpassed oratorical powers, whether in the
agitate or at the bar—his varied talents and acquimments— his criticisms

dwelt upon here. A fen years ago, he married the widow of the late
John Slade, Esq. of Hill-street (now Lady Brougham), by whom he
acquired a =iambic property. By this lady he has, We believe, only
one daughter, who is about eight years of age.—Leeds Ittlelligeneer.

By the arrival of the llercules at Liverpool, from
Buenos Ayres, intelligence has been received to February 11th.
The Mensogero .drgentigto of Feb.ll, contains an atom& of the
capture of Chiloe and of the whole Archipelago connected with it—
thus completing the expulsion of the Spaniards front South America.
The Message* gives the dispatch of the Commander of the ezpedi.
tion, &atom Fume, and the articles of the treaty. Several advan-
tages were gained, and some of the strong positions taken by the
besiegers, who captured the enemy's magazines and artillery on the
14th of January.
This victory was speedily followed by a capitulation, the principal
article of which is that, " The province and archipelago of Chloe,
with the territory which it contains, and which is now in the power
of the Royal army, shall be incorporated with the Republic of
Chili, as an integral part of it, and its inhabitants shall erajoy equality
of rights as citizens of Chili."
The loss of the Republicans did not exceed 16 men killed, and
64 wounded.
Accounts from Buenos Ayres state, that Rtvaimata is appointed
President of the United States of Rio de la Plata, with au income
of twenty thousand dollars per annum, and six Secretaries, of six
thousand dollars each, per annum.

Letters from Corfu, of the 26th April, state that Mis-
Wooed was without pro►isions for nineteen days: they fed on
dogs, and the human flesh of their enemies, and ending all hopes
lost to obtain relief, the garrison attempted to force a passage through
the besieging army, is which they were foiled, and all massacred.
Many of the mothers threw their young children into the sea, to
prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy. An Austrian
packet-boat was sent to Egypt to announce the fall of Ma place.

This forenoon we ►eceived Brussels Papers to the
tell instant ; but they contsin no intelligence of any interest.

The Vienna (Lzeue, received this snowing, contains
the resolution of the Essrestoe en the v.:presentation of the Diet of
Ilungary, listed 20th January. ibis resolution agrees with the
demands of the Estates, with a very few restrictions.

We have received the German Papers to the 13th inst.
They contain an article from Sr.. Petersburgh, explaining the cir-
cumstances under which the late Faresaon has forbidden the sale of
children by the Kirghis and Kalmucks, which was carried on with
great cruelty in the whole line of Siberia and Orenburg. These
tribes, in their predatory excur►ions, carried oif children, which they
exposed in open market fur sale and barter; the ordinary price of
a stolen Kirghis child was frnm ten to twenty6ve rubles. This
specks of robbery was generally practised in the spring. The persons
engaged in this trade kept the children they had purchased in the
hardest slavery. accompanied with all kinds of privations,till the next
December or January, when they took them in waggons, in great
numbers, to the animal fair at [shit, where citizens or merchants
purchased them ss ith money or goods, or sometimes received them
as present•. The Kirghis and ii:dinucks, it is said, when in times
of scarcity their stores of provisions ate t ;donated, often send their

own children for sale to the markets. These unhappy victims ar.
also considered in the most humane manner in the Decree of the
Council of the Empire, of October 20, 1826. The Central Autho
ritietrof Siberia and Orenburg are enjoined to fix the expenses of
maintaining them, to place them with humane •illagers, who are to
be indemnified for their trouble in bringing them up by the labour
of these children when they are older. After a cattail number of
years, the latter become wholly free.

Tire French Papers of Tuesday and Wednesday har•e
reached us. Those of the former day are principally tailed with a
report of the debate in the Chamber of Deputies, on Monday, on
the subject of the Estimates. In thts debate two royalist Members
Attacked the French Ministers with much asperity.
One of these Papers contains a further account of the fall of
' Missolonghi, in which it is states that the heroic garrison and basa-
-1
bitants of that town, besides being impelled by famine, were
betrayed by some secret agents of their enemies, who, after persuad-
ing them to leave at night a place which they had defended for a
year against numerous armies, led them to a masked battery prepared
for their destruction, by which their choicest warriors were instantly
annihilated. The other divisions.who had under their care the women
and children, then endeavoured to regain the town, which they
found in possession of the Egyptians. They succeeded, however,
in re.occupy;ng some houses, where they sustained the charge
of multitudes, till, finding themselves almost overpowered, they
met fire to their powder and perished with many of the besiegers.
Between three and four thousand women anti children are said to
have fallen alive into :he hands of Isaattam PIICHA, who are spared
for slavery. These Papers contain a ion,: letter from Don Alm:ix:a
his Royal Si-ter the Parscass Ratalar, in which he expresses his
perfect readiness to submit in all things to the will of the late Kim:
tie disclaims, pointedly, the most distant intention of authorising
or countenancing, either directly or indirectly, any machination
against the tranquillity of the State; and be calls on his august
Sister, in the possible event of any person's attempting to create
disturbances, under the pretended sanction of his name, to make
use of his letter for the purpose of disclaiming, on his part, any
thing appro.ching to participation in their counsels, or approbation
of their measures.

Last night, in the House (if Comm as, the ArroßsEY-
Gr.saa.ss. obtained leave to bring in a Bill, founded on the Chancery
Report. The Bonded Corn and Corn Importation Bills were read
a third time, and passed: they will be introduced into the House
of Lords this Evening.
The House of Commons will this evening adjourn to Friday next.

The advice: from Turkey. contained in the French
Papers received last night, althoogh not of a later
date than those previously received, are, however, of
some importance. The defeat of the Greek fleet off
-. Ohio, 'and the dispersion of the troops under Colonel
• Palmist, who were besieging the principal fortress
of that island, which was mentioned in a vague manner
in former accounts, is now fully confirmed. The Greeks
. are said to have been so alarmed at the appearance of
TAHIR PACHA as to have embarked in their remaining
vessels, and evacuated the island, leaving all their
baggage and cannon behind. The report that laaAnthr
PACHA had been summoned by Sir F. ADAM to retire
from the Morea, is repeated in the Augsburg Gazette.
The same Journal adds, that Count CAPO p'lsrala
bad declared that he would use his best endeavours
to prevent the invader from quitting the country
unti► he should have restored the Greeks whom
he bad seduced to slavery. The evacuation of
kaiak la the French troops is mentioned in a letter
from Maifid, but with some doubt as to the giving up
of Cadiz aad the Sim d'Urgel ; the retention of the latter

ce is said to be particularly desired by the French
yernment,

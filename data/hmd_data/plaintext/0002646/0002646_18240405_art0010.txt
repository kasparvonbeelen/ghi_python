Although the accounts of the Quarter's Revenue will
not be made up until a late hour this evening, yet we
.
believe the returns are highly flattering, and again ex-
hibit an increase, indicative of the growing Prosperity
of this great country. In the Customs alone, we un-
derstand that the returns for the Quarter ending this day
amount tanearly 2,200,0001. being a surplus of upwards
of 70,0001. over the corresponding Quarter last year.

We rejoice that the Slave Trade Piracy Bill has been
passed so early in the Session. No time ought to be,
lost in putting an end to this odious traffic, which some
of the Powers of Europe cling to with a pertinacity so
abhorrent to humanity.—Accounts from Paramaribo,
of the 39th January, relate, that in the night of the 6th
a great number of negroes had been clandestinely car-
ried away by a French brig, called la Legere, Captain
Poussin, and Supercargo Bled, in consequence of which'
the Governor had ordered a general embargo, to hinder
tkese people from escaping, and to trace the negroei
whom they had taken away. By proclamation of the 23d
January, the embargo was taken off, because, as it states,
the abovenamed Supercargo was taken, and 269 Afri-
cans found, and released from the slavery into which the
persons concerned in this shameful traffic were zarry-
ing them.

The French Papers of Thursday, Friday; and Satur-
day have been received—the latter by Exprkis. In the
Chamber of Deputies the usual address.torhe Kiri° had'
been discussed, and- there was no doubt' would be
adopted. The project of law for the septennial _dura-
tion of the Charnber, •which is to " close the great
wound of the Revolution," is to be presented to. the
Legislature to-day, as well as the Budget for
.11825.
The Spanish prisoners in France, amounting to 3,733
,men, have received orders to set out in columns for Spain.
According to a letter from MAdrid, contained in the
Indicateur de Bourdeaux, and dated March 22, an Ex-
traordinary Gazette hid been published in that capital,
announcing that peace had been concluded between
Spain and the Regency of Algiers, through the exer-
tions of Chevalier DUBUISSON, Captain of the French
frigate l'Hermione, who had brought back with him 45
Spanish prisoners given up by the Day.

Dutch and Brussels Pipers, to the 3d inst. reached

BRUSSELS, APRIL 2.

The King, considering that commerce, manufactures,
and agriculture, have not yet attained the. degree of
prosperity of which they are susceptible,: biii-decided
by a Resolution of the 29th March, that lists shall hi
opened in the Chambers of Commerce and Manufac-
tures at Amsterdam, Antwerp, Bruges, Brassels, Dort,
Ghent, Leyden, Middleburg, Ostend, and Rotterdam,
where persons may subscribe their names for the pur-
pose of forming .a fund for a Society destined to. en-
'courage the above branches. The fund shall be twelve
millions of florins, and may be raised to 21,,millions, the
interest. shall be 4 per cent. The King will take for

is own account the shares which shall not have been
taken on the last day of June next, to complete the sum
of twelve millions.
The latest accounts from Batavia, of November 8'
mention the capture of the merchant brig, the Genera'
de Koch, Captain Blair, by seven small pirate iiesselso
off Cheribon Point, on the 29th October, after .tbre.
hours combat. The Captaitileaped overboard, and was
picked up twenty-four hours after, and brought td
Batavia. The pilot and three sailors who also leaped,
overboard, have since arrived at Batavia and Indra:-
mayo. It is hoped that Mr. K. Thornton, the owner,
who could not be persuaded to leap overboard, has.,
been spaled by the pirates ; and persons have been sent
to Billiton, Poelo, Lipar, and Lingen, to make inquiries,
and endeavour to obtain his release.
BATAVIA, NOVEMBER 29,
Accounts from Poelo Pinang, (kited the Middle of
October, say, that some fears were entertained of an
tituck from Siamese bands, which have assembled
on the opposite coast of the peninsula of Malacca, in
the territory of Queda, and express their iutenti•m af
fetching away by force from Poelo Pinang the King of
Queda, who tied from his dominions some time ago,

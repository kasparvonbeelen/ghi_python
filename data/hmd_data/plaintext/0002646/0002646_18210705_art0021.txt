PROM THE TIMES.

" Upou the whole, Boxarwatz will go down to posterity as a
man who, having more good at his disposal than any other Po-
tentate of any former age, had actually applied his immense
means in the production of a greater share of mischief and mi-
sery to his fellow-creaturesâ€”one who, on the basis of French
liberty, might have founded that of every other State in Europe;
hut who carried on./ series of aggressions against foreign States,
to divert the minds of his own subjects from the sense of their
domestic slavery ; thus imposing on foreign Nations a necessity
for arming, to shake off his yoke, and affording to foreign Des-
pots a pretext fur following his example."

CELEBR ATION OF HIS MAJESTY'S BIRTH-
DA YIN AMERICA. -

The Anniversary of his MAJESTY'S Birth-day was
.elebrated at Boston, in America, on St. George's
Day, by the English, Scotch, and Irish Gentlemen,
by a grand dinner, at which GEORGE MANNERS, Esq.
the British Consul, presided. In the course of the
evening the following sweet verses were sung :
Though destiu'd afar from our country to roam,
Our bosn&s feel proudly that country's our hose;
And ballow'd be ever the bumper which flows
To the ides where the boars f our fathers repose!
Though Commerce ailure us, and oceans divide,
• The /and of.our birth is the land of our pride;
Aod blest be the friends, and accurs'd be the foes.
Of the ides where the bones of our fathers repose!
Blest isles! where spontaneously Liberty springs,
Protected and cherish'd by Loyalty's wings;
We exult in your bliss—we still weep for your woes,
Dear isles! where the bones of our fathers repose!
Long, bin may ye flourish, united and free,
Aod lonig may your freighted ships whiten Zhe sea;
Your !senors stW triumph, when nations oppose,
•
The isles where the bones of our fathers repose !
Wherever we wander in life's thorny ways,
May our pais lead to haste, ere the end of our days;
And our ev'oings at last with warnity close,
In the ides Wherelhe boor% of our fathers repose!
ihit toy song glows toe grave—ties a bumper and join,
To the wreath where Hose, Thistle, and Asaninxk combine,
litre's their linvers to the friends, and their thornsto the foes
Of the isles where the bones of our fathers zepose I

The late General Score, so celebrated for his suc-
cess in gaming, was one evening playing very deep
with the Count D'Artrots and the Duke Ds CHAR-
'Eh, at Paris, when a Petition was brought up from
widow of a French Officer, stating her various
iisfortunes, and praying relief; a plate was handed
roilnd, and each put in one, two, or three louis d'ors ;
it when it was held to the General, who was going
throw for a stake of .500 louis d'ors, he said," Stop
A moment if you please, Sir; here goes for the widow!"
The throw was successful, and he instantly swept the
whole into the palate, and sent it down to her.
The town of Gravesend was on Thursday last the
of much bustle, iu consequence of an elope-
which took place between an Officer, said to
. the Guards, and the daughter of a General.—
attachment had subsisted for some time between
pasties; their union, however, was opposed by
family of the young lady, who determined to
prevent it by sending her to the East Indies. She
was put on board a vessel lying off Gravesend, in
with her father and brothers, and was to
sailed on the following day. Her lover by
some means gained information of her situation, and
~i to the scene of action with- a determination
of making an effort to recover the fair one. He suc-
ceeded in conveying a request to her that she would
hold herself in readiness to escape, if a boat with
certain math should approach the ship. About
'n in the evening he started iu disguise, with four
iterous towers, and as he neared the ship, he per-
ceived with his. glass the lady walking the deck ; he
boldly approached, and in'an instant the fair damsel,
in the presence of father and brothers, who had not
the slightest suspiciou that such a coup de maul; was
contemplation, slipped down the side of the vessel,
and was carried off. They were quickly pursued to
Gravesend, where they were delayed iu procuring
post horses, and fortune once more appeared to be
against them. The father and brothers accidentally
entered die very house where the fugitives were, and
insisted that the lady should be given up. By this
:hue the circumstances of the case were all known
in the town, and it was intimated to the Captain by
some of the reside,* ssatermen, who are always upon
look-out for what they term "a lark," that wheal
all was ready, he should not be prevented from car
-
tying off the object of his wishes. A chaise and four
was soon procured, when a determined scuffle took
might, however, overcame right, and again
_ the friends the mortification of seeing the lady
By before their faces. They were quickly followed
to London, and traced as far as Cliarill-cross, where'
no further clue could be gained to guide pursuit.—
The lady is young, and of very interesting appear-
ance. tier lover was well supplied with money.
Early on Thursday morning, the wife of a re-
spectable baker, in Tichfield-street, St. Mary-la-bonne,
eloped with an Irish labourer, taking with her one
hundred and thirty sovereigns, and a large quantity
silver. The fair ersaaturera has left one child, and
the gallant a wife and two children, the unfortunate
mother of whom is now in a very advanced state of
pregnancy.
It is determined in future to convey the Mails to
the Continent by steam-boats. Two vessels, with
engines of eighty-horse power, are now building for
the Dover station, and are expected to be ready for
sea in about six weeks.
. A fine new Steam Packet, called the Nottingham,
sailed from Gainsborough on Monday se'nnight,
with two hundred passengers on board, for hull,
'panied by a band of music. melancholy
accident occurred off White Cliff, six miles from
Hull: a young man of the name of Flood, a joiner,
who worked on board the packet, fell overboard, in
a state of intoxication, and was drowned. This acci-
dent damped the hilarity of the day, the packet
arriving at Hull with colours half hoisted, and with-.
out any music playing.
Extract of a letter from Rio Janeiro, dated 14th
Av.' 1821 :—" The number of slaves imported into
alone, in the course of a year, is.from 20 to
besides what are imported into the other
the Brazils. It is a pitiable sight to see some
of them landed; where disease or bad usage
'.on them, they have often to be carried, being
literally nothing but skin and bone. They are all (alter
being landed) marched up to the slave market, where
they are exposed tovale ; and I have seen the buyers
looking them over just as you would do a horse,
making them hold up their legs, bow their bodies, &c.
Thus slavery is here in its very worst state. From the
cheapness at which the slaves can be bought, they are
not taken :hat care of which they ought, and are often
shamefully abused : the law does not protect them ;
you may take the life of your slave, and never be
called in question for it—he is your properly, you can
do with hint as you please. And are the Portuguese
the only nation that is to be allowed to carry on this
cursed traffic? Surely not. I trust it will be one of
the first acts of the new Government to abolish for
ever a trade which has been so long the disgrace of
the Portuguese nation."

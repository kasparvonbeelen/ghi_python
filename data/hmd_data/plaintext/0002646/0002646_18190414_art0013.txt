- : DRURY-LANZ, IN THE SPRING OF 1818.
In the spring of 1818, I entered into a treaty with
the Drury-lane Committee for twelve nights ;tl
risk -ins entirely on my side, in case of fa** the
first night—and in the *event of ' success, tartmOln-
:. meats depended entirely on their liberality, no pe-
cuniary stipulations being made. Imogine, in Ben;
tram, was the part fixed upon for my debut; . and the
part, correctly written from the Prompter's book,
was sent to me in Waterford. Immediately on. 'tn;
•• arrival in town, I.had a meeting with the Committee;
two rehearsals were appointed, and my first appear-
arce in Imogine fixed for the following week: severs'
days passed, but neither rehearsal nor performance
took place-, nor any reason assigned for the delay•
at length- I wrote to inquire the cause, and was -
formed in. reply—" T/iat Mr. Kean 's time was
Ally occupied, it was impossible to fir his attention
Bertram for the present."
• Leonid not conceive what attentions could be re-
quisite on the part-of Mr. KEAN, to a character whit
he must have performed at least forty or fifty times,
but I plainly saw some
.Anil play .was, in meditatien.
I wfote a letter to -the •Conunittee, stating, that'
Mr;KRAN had any objection perform with me, .
: . had not arty desire to perform'ivith him; and though
I should prefer Imogine to ail other characters as .
fiat appearanee, yet I would'change it to any other
more suites to the convenience of the Theatras..-/3c/-

make this assertion was strange; as
.we had never by

.20th year ; previous to that age, I. had led the bus:
n..-ss of the. Belfast Theatre, and-Bind been honoured
with the public encomiums of .Mrs."SiniaO•s; when
•Mr. Keart was scarcely trusted to deliver a message.
. That I had, fur the last -three years, devoted m7'
talent to the charity Plays of Ireland, was a circum•
stance advanced.as rendering me unfit for the: busi•
r.-ris of a regular Theatre. . .
• Irrumerable were the insults, degradations, and
arrietiec I had to encounter, until the accidental
arrival of a Gentleman from the North, who inter-
fered-and demanded the performance:of my-engage-

OSkeTUS OF THE ST. KATHARINE
DOCK COMPANY.
CONSTITUTED A JOINT STOCK COMPANY
• By an Act of the 6th Geo. IV. 1825.

THIS important 'undertaking is supported by many
of the leading, Merchants, Ship-owners, and Traders of .the
Metropolis, who are deeply interested In promoting Its commercial
prosperity.

The necessity of giving to the public additional convenient Wet
Deck and bonding accommodation near the seat of business in the
Port of London, and of securing to it a reduction in the rates and
charges, has long been experienced. Moderate rates upon the
boding, housing, rent, shipping, &e. 4f gouda, are essential for the
purpose of bringing this port nearer to a level in point of expense,
net only with the other ports of the Empire to which the privilege
of bonding is extended, but more particularly with the principal
ports of the continent of Europe; which, in consequence of their
lower charger, attract a very large proportion of the trade of transit,
which would otherwise rmort to London.
The prosperity which cannot but attend that lucrative branch of
commerce, under the improved commercial code of the country,
especially if accompanied by a diminution in the port charges, must
be apparent from the greit increase which, even under existing
citeurnitances, has already been experienced, since the passing of
the Warehousing Act in July, 1825,—four-filths of which increase
has been enjoyedby the port of London.
The London Dock. is the only general bonding establishment
within three miles and a half from the Royal Baclange, and that
establishment dues not afford accommodation for the Increase of
trade which his already taken place; still less, therefore, can it
provide fur the additional extent of business that rosy confidently
be expected to "low out of those enlightened principles of legis-
lation which are so eminently calculated to promote and extend
the commerce and navigation of the British Empire; and make the
'Port of London the Emporium of the World. •
'rho place which has been selected for the construction of the
'proposed Docks, Warehouses, Quays, &c. whirls will be snr-
rmanded with alls, so as to entitle them to all the privileges of
the Warehousing System and of Legal Quays, is situated between
the'TOwi:r and the London Docks; a situation unparalleled In
&int of convenience.
The advanced state of Science in Engineering and Architeentre,
with the present price of building mitetials, will enable the Rru:
meters orthe measure, notwithstanding the comparatively limited
site, to, afford to the public accommodation for warehousing,hond-
ing, and QtpaY-room, nearly equal in extent to the London Docks ;
and froth an improved construction of the Warehouses, which
will be erected within a few feet of the margin of the Docks and
Basin, a very considerable annual saving will be effected in the ex-
pense of labonrage.
It is computed that the St. Katharine Docks and Basin, will
with great convenience afford accommodation, annually, for
about 1400. Merchant Ships, including private trade Indiamen ;
besides Craft for loading and discharging. Increased facilities will
be afforded to the ingress and egress of Shipping, by the improved
application of mechanical powers, by means of which ships and
lighters, at a very trifling expense to the Company, may, in the
night as well as by day, be locked in and out of the Docks du-
ring any period of tide ; as the sills of the outward gates will be
so constructed es to provide for ten feet depth at low water, and
from twenty-six to thirty feet at the height of spring tides.
According to the estimates proved before Committees of Parlia-
ment, the total cost of the site, the purchase of buildings, leases, and
the various interests concerned, including compensations and ex-
penses of carrying the Act into execution, will be about X 1,550,000,
whilst the Capital Stock of the. London Dock Company amounts to
upwards of 1C3,200,000.

Calculating upon the above estimates of outlay, with an ample
prevision for extraordinary contingencies and unforeseen demands,
including a reserve fund, and•making large allowances for a reduc-
tion in the rates of the Port, the profits are estimated to be such as
will yield a highly satisfactory return to the Subscribers on their in-
vestment.• The profits thus estimated may be anticipated with the
greater confidence, because the calculation proceeds on the supposi-
tion of an extent of business equal to only three-fourths of the ca-
pacity of the proposed Docks and Warehouses, whereas it may
fairly be expected, that the inestimable advantage of proximity of
situation, and the attention which will be paid to every possible im-
provement in management, may secure full employment, and, con-
sequently, still larger returns to the Proprietors.

The Act provides for the payment of Interest to thelubscribers
upon their instalments, after the rate of Four per Cent. per Ann.
until the works shall have been completed.
A deposit bf Five per Cent. upon the sums subscribed has been
made; and upon payment of the first Call, a Scrip Receipt.will be
issued to the Proprietors;. sites which, Sales of Shares may take
...pbeees”-The Calls are limited to Teu per Cent. upon a Two
- Notice.
• • He person will be answerable beyond the amount of the Stock
vatanding in his name.
.A 1 eke expiration of one year, to be reckoned from the opening
Of the Docks for business, a dividend will be declared and paid ;
and Aker that period half-yearly ; regard being had to the creation
of a.enerved fund for repairs and contingencies.
)An account of the concerns of the Company for the preceding
be laid ,before the Proprietors at the annual meetings,
rood may be inspected by them, a few days previous to such meetings.

THE ELEMENTS OF USEFUL LITERATURE.
New Editions are published, by Gm. B. Wurpr*am, Ave Maria-
lane, price Ninepence each, of
pINNOCK'S CATECHISMS of the ARTS-and
SCIENCES.
These Catechism' are intended to form the basis of every branch
of useful knowledge, and are of themselves, in fact, " an Epitome
of the Arts and Sciences." The style in which they are written is
at once dear and simple, conveying instruction to the youthful mind
in a manner unattainable by the use of more elaborate and compre-
hensive Works. In short, while they fix on the mind the leading
facts in Hi story, and the fundamental principles of Science, the
Memory is relieved from the burden of retaining a maw of onliuthe
with which larger books necessarily abound. They consist of se-
parate Catechisms on the following subjects :
Uriculture General Knowledge Mental Philosophy
Algebra, 4 parts Geography Mineralogy
Anatomy Geology Modern History
Ancient History Geometry Morality
Ancient Geography German Grammar Music
Architecture Greek Grammar Mythology
Arithmetic • Hebrew Grammar Natural History

APPEALS.
The Earl of LIVERPOOL, pursuant to his notice,
rose to call the attention of the House to the present
state of its appellant jurisdiction. Their Lordships.were:
aware that a Committee bad been appointed two years:
ago, in consequence of the immense number of appeals,.
to consider the means of getting rid of the accumulating
mass. The difficulties at the tune appeared so great,
that the feeling with" which the Committee entered:
upon its labours was one nearly approaching to despair.
It would be seen by the first paragraph of the first Re-
port that the majotity of the Appeals cattle from Scot-
land, there being not less than 151 Szotch Appeals'oot
of 225, and that according to the mode of proceeding
thenyetisting, the whole could not be possibly disposed'
of in five years. N,)w by the course which had been.
adopted, there was scarcely onp of those Appeals which
was not already settled. It had been thought that if
the question of arrears could be got rid of, a hope might
be entertained, by wholesome regulations, Such as:hose
which bad been adopted in the administration of the
law in Scotland, tending to separate the law from the
fact, that the number of Appeals might be decreased.
The measure founded on this principle was beginning
to work, its beneficial effects had therefore not yet been
felt, but would • soon become apparent. But the va-
luable suggestions contained in the Report of the Com-
mittee had produced more immediate results. Instead
of three, the House had dedicated five days every week,
from ten o'clock in the morning till the boor tsf public
business to the bearing of Appeal causes; and as his
Noble Friend on the Woolsack could not attend at that
time consistently with his duties in another place,' and
as his Majesty bad the advantage of having a learned
individual who had made the law of Scotland his par.:
titular study, that learned individual had been Spa
pointed to preside, in the capacity of Deputy Speaker;
at the hearing of Appeals. Those set down for hearing
at the beginning of 1824 amounted to 282, besides '74
Writs of Error, in all 556. During the course of the,
last Session, by enforcing the regulations of tbe House)
and with the aid of the Learned LOrd who presided;
186 Appeals had been disposed of, forty of which had
been struck off by the Committee, and the rest heard
and deeded, leaving only 170 Appeals and Wits of
Error unheard at the close of the Session. Besides
the arrears, however, those coming in were also to be
looked to. At the commencement of the present Set.
sion there"were fifty-two additional Appeals and Writs
of Error, making in all two hundred and one Appeals
and 28 Writs of Error, or a total of 229 instead of 356.

Y

Out of these there had been disposed of to the present
day 126, so that there remained only to decide on 103
Appeals and Writs of Error. If the House proceeded
at the same rate, even allowing the Appeals from Ire-
land and Scotland to be as numerous as at the begin.
sing of the present Session, so as to reach 150 or 155.
another ye 'r would conclude the whole, or 96 or. 27
only would be left, which would be so trifling a consi-
deration, that the evil might be considered as cum.
pletely conquered. This he said without en- y reference
to the diminution which might be expected to take place
in the number of appeals, in consequence of the int-
provements effected in the admiaistrationof the law in
Scotland. It bad been said. that the more Appeals
were disposed. of, the more new ones mould abound.
But this he thought would never be the e tie. Appeals
were generally resorted to for the purpose of creatinz
delay, and when individuals found that they were de-
cided almost as soon as they were received, they would
naturally abstain from incurring the trouble and ex-
penseof making them. This was not only a supposition,
but an established fact; for the Scotch Appeals, shith
in 1823 were 59, in 1824 had decreased to 59, and this
year amounted only to 29. There had therefore been
a rapid diminution, instead of an increase. He should
propose that the House should proceed in. the' same
course next Session, but that one out of the five. days
should be given to the hearing of the Appeals made
during that Session, so as to prevent the creation of any
-batever settlement. mat.

On the medal of Mr. Hawes, the House rewired itself Into
a C,onnaittes.of Supply:
On the kw resolution for pasting 470,0001. far army extracw-
dinaries being pet,' •
Mr. HUME was desirous of calling the attention of
the House to the enormous char s incurred on account
of the colbdi of f3ierr e Leone. sands of lives were
lost in that unhealthy place, thous ads of pounds were
squandered on it, and yet no person really knew how
that settlement was going op, or what good was derived
m fro the sums which were lavished on it. There were
some other items, also, which he wished to notice. There
was, for instance, the "expence incurred on account of
Heligoland. He found an extraordinary allowance for
Colonel King, which he would wish to have explained ;
also, a sum charged for Brigade Major Eckersley for
services dialog four years, and an item of 11,0004 for
the transport of specie, which sum was to be paid to
certain natal officers, who had been in command on
particular sfatisms. There was 1,1571. to Captain C.
Hope, for 3be transport of specie-4othing more than

sent in the ship Brisk. It was, be thought, a lavish
expenditure, to pay a public officer such a sum for
doing a public duty in a ship bfonging to the Ooverp-
ment. ,However, with the exception of these two Of.

Mr.'HUME suggested to the House its paying at•
testion to the statements of Sir G. Collier, who had de-
picted the real state of Sierra Leone. From the report
•of Major Laing it appeared that two years ago there
viten° trace to be found of an European having set his
soot 20 miles inland. What would the House say when
.they considered that the population of Sierra Leone
amoesitod to one million hundred amend, and yet that they
tlesid not raise saalcient •nial produce to support thentselvaa
Mgt actually imported? •
Mr. WILMOT-HORTOttI believed that no measure
.rnot Bien a blockade through the whole line of coast
~could effect the abolition of the made, so long as
4avery existed. He did not think that the Hon.
*ember-for Aberdeen stated the subject fairly by
lauding it in comparative views of expense. It might
is unprofitable to keep an establishment at Sierra
Leone, but the question' was as to its usefulness. In
this view there could be no doubt in any mind, after
duly considerins the circumstance,. The Government
were in possession of many trilling and uninteresting
particulars, which shrew a still clearer light on the
'subject. For instance, an expedition had been planned
and put in motion far penetrating to the centre of
Africa. It would proceed by she route also which the chief part
Mall the captives to be sold were driven in tie mem :The House
'Would see with pleasure, in, this ere •eircunistaisee, the grounds of

The CHANCELLOR of Abe ESCHEQUEE ob.,

for it; but the fact was sae however, it might be a,

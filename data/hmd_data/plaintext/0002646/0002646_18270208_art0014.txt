Another week of steady progressive improvement
has been experienced by most of our manufacturers of
cotton goods. Some houses, that six moral)s ago had
dismissed nearly their whole establishment of workers,
have, during the last fortnight, been so pushed to cons.
pieta orders, that their full complement (f hands has
been employed both night and day.
The Demerara Papers contain two Proclamations,
the purport of which is, that his M AMITY has been
graciously pleased to sanction and confirm an Act passed
by the Legislature of this colony in May, 1'2.5, for
mere hilly ascertaining the slave population of Deme-
rara and Essequibo, and had appointed Sir C. W. Boa-
Dm, Bart- and J. ICINCHELA. Esq. LLD. Commis-
sioners to inquire into the state of all Africans liberated
from slavery in the West India and &lath American
settlements, which Commissioners having arrived in
this colony, all persons are diiected and enjoined to re-
spect them accordingly, *nd to render them every assist-
ance in fulfilling the object of their Commission.—And
in order to facilitate the Accomplishment of this mea-i
sum, these his Majesty's Commissioners have been in-,
vested with the powers possessed by Deputy Pocals,
and are authorised to take examinations on oath, though
merely in cases connected with their Commissions.

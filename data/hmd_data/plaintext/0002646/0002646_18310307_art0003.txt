ENDOWMENT OF NEW CHURCHES.

The Bishop of London has introduced a Bill " to amend and render
more eft -crust an Act passed in the seventh and eighth yeas of the
reign of his late Majesty, intituled an Act to amend the Acts for building
and promoting the building of additional churches in populous parishes."
Having recited the existing Acts, the preamble sets forth that, by the
sth of his late Majesty. it was, amongst other things, enacted, that with
a view to afford facility to the erection of churches and chapels, it ,
should be lawful for certain persons building or purchasing the same,
and endowing them with pew rents, to nominate for 40 years spiritual
persons to serve such churches or chapels respectively, subject to the,
consent of the Bishop of the diocese, and to certain regulations therein
provided : And whereas by the said recited Act, passed in the 7th and
Bth years of his late Majesty, further encouragement was given to the
same ohjtct, by authorising his Majesty's Commissioners for building
new churches to declare that any person or persons building a chapel,
and endowingthe same to the satisfaction of the said Commissioners,
with sonic permanent provision in land or monies in the funds, should
have the perpetual right of nominating the minister to serve the same:
And whereas the said provisions of the said last recited AcChave been
found insufficient for such their purposes, and require amendment, in
order to provide more effictually for the improved pastoral superintend-
ence of his Majesty's subjects, &C.
The Bill then declares that so much of the said recited Act 7th and
Bth Geo IV., c. 77, as authorises the Commissioners in certain cases to
declare the right of nominating to be repealed.
Then, thar in all cases where churches or chapels have been built and
endowed to the satisfaction of the Commissioners, they may, with the
consent of the Bishop, declare the right of nominating to be in the
persons so endowing.
It then describes the proceedings required previous to the nomination,
the jurisdiction, &c„ and enacts that the Commissioners may subject
such churches to provisions of recited Acts as to pews.

It appears from a parliamentary return, that the number
of retail dealers in England, convicted of adulteration of
beer, from 18/7 to the present time, amounts to 235, and
that five druggists have, during the same time, been con-
victed of similar abominations.

EMIGRATION.
Exttact of a letter dated Jan. 16th, 1831, frotnlar English waist
at Springfield, Massachusetts, to a Mend in Londotre'..o
tc We are all enjoying the best of health, and are happy to hear the
same from you. Our situation in lire is certainly 3 eontra,t to yours :
you are spending one of care, mixed with pleasure and eajorient ,
and we are destitute of either. If I could alienate toys( If frtnn Ens.
land, I could moon possess a house of my own ; but I envy you your
privilege of visiting the drama—of enjoying a pleasant walk —of spend-
ing a convivial boor over the social tube,—these are enjoyments btydnd
my reach now ; I can only recollect that such things were. You will,
perhaps, say, that as 1 am Inca, I ought to overcome these scrupl,:, ,
but could you be content with such a life ?
" That is not home where day by day
T wear the busy hours away—
That is not home where lonely night
Prepares me for the toils of light.'
The poorest devil of a mechanic in England can occasionally enjoy his
pint and pipe; but here, after he has done his work, which is sunset,
lie goes home, and then to bed. On Sundays he must join the pious
crowd, or stay at home ; for our streets are not contaminated by the
foot of pleasure on those days ; there is no attraction in a walk on a fine
Sunday. even were it to pass uncensured, for half a mile, in any direc-
tion from the town, would lead you into the most barren wilderness.
The roads are such as would he hyelanes, and some considered im.
passable in England • but this country ;bounds with beautiful and
navigable rivers, so that commercial business does not suffer from ti,.
far imperfection. If my only object in coming here had been to
il'otain a plentiful table, I shot.lil say, I had accomplished it to the
fullest extent ; and, although 1 have a family, I cannot consider myself
a.; immovable, or that I ought not to seek a life more satisfactory to
me. lam aware that I could possess land, and accumulate pro
perty, by penetrating the western interior. 1 war made sensible of this
in my route of near six hundred miles through the western countries.—
I had some offers, but 1 felt disgusted with the wild country. I had
no relish to become an inhabitant of wild woods and mountains ; I
would prefer living in any country part of land, where I should at
least see stage-coaches and waggons owasienally pass by. But here ynu
must bid good bye to all knowledge of poring events, of money, and
almost tne civilized world. The towns are becoming equally dfsgusting,
few being exempt from religious craft and temperance societies. Bdt
to give America its due, it is to the indigent, perhaps, the must safe
and hospitable country in the whole world. In its infancy as a manu-
facturing country, there arc some trades not very lucrative here; but
starvation never stained the name of America.
" Onetof two things every mechanic must do, either go to his Be,'.'
conventicle, or be always without employment. Americans may call
this liberty, but I think most Englishmen would be apt to consider it
abject slavery."
The writer is a carpenter. Springfield is a large town, with 7,000 inha-
bitants ; 256 miles east of New York, with a very considerable national
Arnow v; hut the religious intolerance is the same in almost every town
attd vil•age, great and small, throughout the United States.

by several lots of Money Stock coming to market;•as well as the

Dutch Papers to the 6th inst. have been received. An
article from Brussels, under the date of the 2d inst.
mentions the arrival in that city of two Greek Primates,
CH RISTODULO ECLORIDI, aged 60, and KHAZZPETRAKI,
aged 50, fugitives from their country, who having seen
their families proscribed, their fortunes confiscated, and
their wives and children carried into slavery, themselves
escaped capital punishment only through the interven-
tion of the French Consul. They are mentioned as'
men eminent for their virtues. What the offence was
which called down upon them the severe sentence to
which they ha'e been subjected, does not appear.--
Under the date of the .sth of September, we are told
that the passage of diplomatic characters through Ber-
lin is very frequent. There are (says this Paper) Am-
bassadors, Generals, Ike. crossing each other in all di-
rections." The following are extracts:

buigh, the annual report of the Opthalamic Hospital.

This action wu instituted to recover damages fr6m
the owner of the ship Glatton. for • having run down
and sunk a vessel belonging to the plaintiffs, called the
Jubilee, as she lay in the river, at Halfway Reach, at
an early hour on the morning of the 80th of December
las,. The defendants rested their case upon tilt. Pilwt
Act, as exempting the Owners from tespon,ibility, a
licensed pilot tieing on hoard at the time of the injury.
They also adduced evidence with a view to shew that
the accident was attributable, at least in an equal degree,
to the person on board the plaintiffs yeisel, ii, neglecting
the necessary precaution against a, probable event, hod
in adopting improper "nianceuvies at the time of the
recurrence, w hich rendered• the cullisiun r.f the vessels
inevitable. The I,l.•intiffi: evidence, however, rebutted
they: allegations, and it appeared that the pilot, although

This was an action of trover brought by the plalirtitsi'
who are the_asignees of a bankrupt. named Weyer,

bion Coal WWI. r. Surrey, to recover from the defend-
ant the v4lue of three ships, transferred to the defend.
ant by his brother-in-law, the bankrupt, When be watt
in a state of insplvency.
From the evideoce of the Oar:Wits it appeared, that
in the early part of 1824, the baiikitipt was in the habit
of getting accommodation acceptances Ed a consider-
able amount, and that before the ships were transfe red
to him, the defendant was aware of the feet. In the
month of July, 1#24. Deevey became a bankrUpi, and
the sums proved under ate c.Mmiision amt,uiqed to
.55,4 a In the month f March or April,' 1824, Mr.
A')el SMitlf. of the house of Smith, Payne, Sm'th,
bankers, called upon the ch f nj.tm, and asked 'him if
Deevey was trust-worthy, and whether he had any ac-
cornmodation bills in circulatian. The defetidant re-
plied. that Deevey was worth 25,0Cf01 arid had net:chr
accommodation bills in Circtilat
In cross-examination, the plaintiff's witnesieisidinitted
that at the time of Deevey's bankruptcy the detendant
was a creditor to a large amount, and that they had not;
at the early part of the mouth ofJune, sfibseqUenify to
the assignment of the ships to the defendant;theleait
notion of the bankrupt's insolvency. One 'Of the‘wit•
nesses offered in the latter end of May to advance the

behind him said) unfortunately West Indian property to souse

there measures relating to slaves in general; bet he should not on
the present occasion give ids support to them in any measure of
coercion. they were about to bring forward on the subject of
slavery. Thithowever had been said of him, and be thought right
to inform the House that such was not his intention. He thought
it would be • better to leave three things in the hinds of the

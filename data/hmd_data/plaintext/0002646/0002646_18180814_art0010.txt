" With heartfelt and unfeigned sorrow, we an-
nounce the untimely and-distressing death f the gal
butt Maiar Benjlmin Birdsall, of the • United States'
army. lie was shot on parade this evening, a few
minutes before eight, and his immortal spirit left its
tabernacle of clay in one hour and fifty-five minutes
afterwards. He was shot by a soldier of tl:e name
of Hamilton, who had been enli.ted about three
months. 'lie murder was deliberate, :tad the mons-
ter exults atits perpetration—he is ill prison.
" Major Birdsall was in conversation with Lieute-
nant Scott, in front of his marquee. liamilton pre-
ented himself before them, and .11:ijor, I am
here. On being ordered back to the tauls, he made
ready and discharged his rifle.--the ball entered on
the right side, passed near the heart, and lodged in
the flesh near the Sack-bone.

" The high-minded soldier met danger in its most
terrific forms--wn.s mutilated in the most 'cruek man-
ner, by having his face literally shattered to pieces ;
has undergone surgical operations of the most ago-
nising nature ; suffered pains indescribable ; his
wounds but jug healed ; his prospect of returning
happiness had barely began to dawn, and he has fallen
the victim,of unprovoked assassination.
" W 4 learn that Hamilton committed suicide on
Monday morning."

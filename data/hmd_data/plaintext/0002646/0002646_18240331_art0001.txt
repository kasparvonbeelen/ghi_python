menced on rriday last, was resumed this morning after prayers,
when Mr. A3tECROMET was 'ward as setond Counsel for the ap.
Tenants. Mr. ATTOUNET-GEESEA.I. PIA IMr..Marszies were then
heard for the re ;arat..lerr, and Mr. Mutiaae in reply. This appesi,
was taken from certain Literlocutors of the'Second Div;aien ti the

cause, and of the whtile proceedings in tik Conn Wiwi. His Lord-
ship remarked, that no such action had ever been recognised intik'
law of England ; and that, after the utmost ability and industry;
which had been displayed by the C•iiiiisel• fqr the appellant's, they
bad beeri unable to point oat a siee instance in which such pro-
ceedings had elm, before been resorted to in -the Courts of that
kingdom. Oa these grounds, as well alibi "oentemplation of the
mischi-vous consequeuces which must arise from giiskrig •,tticourage-
mem to such actions, his Loidship moved that the iutyglocutors ap-
pealed from be affirmed with costs.—Or.lered. . _ ...

Divisiotinf the Court of Session in Scistlattd) Mr. KEAY, of the Scot-
tish Bar, was heard for the appelients.—To proceed on Thursdity.
Ills Ropl Highness the Duke of lioas sat at the table beside
Lord Gtrroao the whole of the morninkand appeared to pay very
great attention to the judicial bUsinesa O% for Ward.

Mr. Secaastatt, from the Treasury, delivered the Annnsl Ac-
counts hi relation to the Public Debt sad the Won't)! Admiralty..
Petitions were presented lay Lord Cassaoara from Thuile, from
Woburn, and other places, praying fur the gradual abolition and ul-
tim!ste extinction of Slavery. .
The Earl of MORLEY presented i Petition in favour of the
Plymouth Improvement Bill front the Inhabitants of that town.—
Laid, as were the previous Petitions, on the table. . -
Upon the motion of the Earl of Sitervassusv, their Lordships
went into a Committee on the Penitentiary Convicts Bill, which
was reported without an amendment.
The Duke of MONTROSE presented.a trtltlott from.Kincar-
dine, in praying for the abolition of Slavery ; which was
laid upon the 'table. • .
The Marquis of LANSDOWN said that he luLl in his hand
a Petition, which, it appeared, was signed by the most reepoct-
able-silk manufactuVers and throwsters in Spitalfielde and its vici-
nity, whose prayer was, that their Lordships would be plerisesi to
pause before they passed a Bill nosy in progress through the House.
It was the opinion of the Petitioners that the,silk trade could not
continue to flourish if that measure were passed, is they •net-er
could compete with foreigners in the market. They prayed, at Al
events, that the period proposed for commencing the operation of
the pending Bill might• be extended from two to five years, in or-
der•to enable the Petitioners to alter their arranuments with re-
gard to the manufacture of silk, by getting fresh rooms, procuring
new patterns, and other means of competition. In pc...sewing
this Petition, the Noble Marquis added, that Ise was inclined oir
maintain, though with some ditfldence, the opinion he already held,
and had avowed to their Lordships at differene times upon this
subject, by anticipating that the mule itself would flourish more
under the proposed new sysiem than under the former one ; and
that, iii nine cases out of ten, the trade would, instead of diminn-
don, nod an extended deer td for manufacturer! silks. Under this
persuasion, he certainly could not oppose the Bill ; but, at the s min
timer. he tijought that the Petitioners were_ entitled to fait, consi-
deration from his Majesty's Government, and t that 'attention from
their Lordships which the nature of their appli atien shOuld seem
to require. He had now only to move that the I etition be read.
Upon the further Motion of the Noble Marti is, the Petition,
first being read, was laid upon the table.

:, n .1-:- : ABOLITION OF SLAVERY. ,
- Bad BATHURST, on the Order of the Day being
read fctergoinginto a Committee on the Slave trade
Piracy Bill. expressed his earnest wish thattheir Lord.
ships would suffer- no further time to be.lost.. Tltel:
were stipulations with the United States of Ametica foe
the extinction- of the traffic in slaves,. which Might re,
suit in some conversation, which, however, could not
be ratified by the 'United .Status before the present Bill
had reached them., : It.was highly desirable that, upon
this account, the Bill should reach America before the
rising of the Congress; as_otherwise it must remain un
ratified till N-rveniber next. He hoped,ro....ciieuni
• . •
stanced, that -their Lordships would agree to negative
.
the question for. committing so important a and
order that it should now
.be read a third time.
Earl GROSVENOR, on the Motion being agreed to,
assuredlheir Lordships that he was quite as earnest for
.
passing the'Bill as the Noble Earl opposite could. possi-
bly be. He regarded the measure as One. highly:to the
•hotwor of this country, whirl), after a struggle of pearly
fotty years in the sacred cause of humanity and jus-
tice, had achieved a victory fir above all sublun.r-y
fame. It was not less gratifying to reflect, that although
some champions iu this noble cause were numbered
with the departed great, still the Clarksons aoti the.
Wilberforces were living to witnessthat trintoph•xo
which their exertions had contributed so: much. But
he wished to take this opportunity to pres nem; the
Noble Earl certain points connected with.tbe presont
Bill, as respecting the instructions sent out by his Ma-
jesty's Government for the adoption of the Colonies.
He joined 'most heartily in the spirit and tendency of
those instructions; but lie entertained the same 'appre-
hensions with regard to some of the I•slandswhich.be.
had expressed to a Noble Earl (Liverpool) uot-i;present
now in the House, and it was upon this head be:wiilied
for explanation from the Noble Earl opposite, since the
object of. the' instructions las toleadltimately to the
abolition of slaver y. With regard, for instance, %I the
~.. -
manumission of slaves, it was represented. that fifes
had already been proeided. by at) Act passed fdtjrje9i

Saturday night, Miss l'AvoN made her prnal.V.t
pearance as Clari, in the Opera of ti.at nen:.
PATotes Clad, in the play scene, that with t'e
and the meeting with her parents, lost none of thew
wonted power over the sympathies of the adietict_
The part bad clearly been studied after the pirre
model of its original representative ; and if there Vtle
a few things which did not bear the test of comperiss%
they were such as are independent of intellectual
quirement. Our first Clari imprerted to the last stet A
depth of pathos which was beyond the re.rch
art or of feeling. That drooping, wasted form, nil
those broken and subdued accents, which might but
fallen from the lips of grief itself—they were the gifts
of nature, and cannot be imitated. The revival of this
Opera would delight the lovers of fine acting, trete it
only for the opportunity of seeing Mr. Fawcerft
Rolcusso. The only departure from the usu4l cast of the
piece was in giving the Duke to Mr. PowER, and .li,
melte to Miss Hat.m.—The amusing Farce of Er
Scapegoat followed, in which Mr. FARRIIN kept Lie
House in continued laughter.

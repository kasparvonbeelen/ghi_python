slaves should have Sunday to themselves for rest and
recreation—that they should be enabled to hold pro-
perty—that the venditioni exponas should, if possible,
be got rid of—that they should be entitled to give
evidence in a Court of Justice—but upon the subject
of the children of slaves the Right Honourable Gen-
tleman was silent.
Mr. Secretary CANNING said, if he was asked
whether he meant to assert that the progeny of slaves
were never to he free, he would answer. in the nega-
tive ; but he did object to throw out loose hints that
might be detrimental to individual interests. He ab-
jured the principle of perpetual slavery, but he was
unable to fix the term when it ought to expire—nor
was he able to point out by what precise process we
were to arrive at its conclusion.
Wir. BUXTON felt obliged to the Right Hon. Gentleman for
the very decisive manner in which he had expressed himself, and
for that reason he would withdraw his motion—(Hear, hear).
The Original Motion was then withdrawn, and the Amend-
ment agreed to.—The `other Orders of the Day having been dis-
po..ed of, the House adjourned at Half-past One.

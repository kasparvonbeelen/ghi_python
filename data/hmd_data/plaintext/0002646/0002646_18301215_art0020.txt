LABOURING POOR.

Mr. SADLER gave notice, that on the 24th of February, he si.uuld
move for leave to bring in a bill tor bettering the state of the labouring
poor in England.

Air. 51ACAULEY presented, tied up in a bundle, upwards of 200

bk. DUNDAB.B SINECURES.

Slr. DUNDAS availed himself of this opportunity to correct a state •
ment respecting him, that his two offices produced 7,0001. a year. This
was by no means the fact—his receipts were 4,5001; and his office ra.
dered him liable to any clerical errors made by his clerks. Fur one of
his clerks he paid 2001. and for another 4001.

➢lr. KENNEDY observed that he was glad to hear this expLination.
He did not wish to make any accusation against the right hon. gentle.
man ; but lie had felt justified in making observations respecting hvg
Majesty's late ministry. He had done no more. He was glad to brat
that the right hon. gentleman had but 4,5001. instead of 7,ootiL ; but,
at the same time, he could not avoid saying, that he knew of ■o services
that entitled the right hon. gentleman to such pay out of the public
service.

Sir GEORGE WARRENDER observed that the returns had
many inaccuracies in them. The Marlborough family received 3,5001.
hotted of 5,0001. He did not grudge rewards for services to the pub.
lie, but he would press the abolition of sinecures. He said, if the
ministers did nothing on the subject, he should move that there be a
reduction of 2711 per cent from all sinecures, where these offices were
given fur peculiar services to ancestors. He should like them to
imitate the example of the late Lord Stair, who, immediately o:;
coming to his paternal estate, resigned his 1,6110 a-year—others had nut
pursued that course.
Mr. EWART trusted that all sinecures would be abolished.
Dl. THILLPOTTIL

Mr. PHILLPOTTS asked whether the Ministers had made up ti e:r
mind as to what course they would pursue respecting the living phn
mised the Bishop of Exeter, to be held by him ad commendans.
Lord ALTHORP observed, that the Government had determined
that it was a gross piece of abuse of patronage to confer a living with
a Bishop where die distance between the places was so great. It vas
on that principle alone that the Government had come to the resolu-
tion respecting the cases, not from any personal motives, not 14::it
any reference to the party in whom the Bishopric and living were
to be conferred ; at the same time the Government could re:
but think that the case of the Right Reverend Prelate r:s
rather hard, for with the bishopric the living had b.tn
promised, and they therefore had come to the determination of
offering to him the first piece of patronage not connected with the can.
of lords, to the acceptance of this Right Rev, personage's, feeling
the two appointments were incompatible. The government had to:
confirmed the granting of the building, and feeling that such promotions
seriously tatted the interests of the church, the government had deter.
mined in no way to countenance them.—(Cheers.)

cil had a meeting yesterday morning, to hear appeals from

PRESTON ELECTION .••••FIETH D•T.•••••At two 0%:10Ck
this afternoon, Mr. Hunt bad
gained a considerable majority
over his opponent on the day's poll; and at that hour, on the
gross poll, he was above five hundred a-head. Mr. Hunt
has not yet made his appearance in Preston, but his re-
turn is considered certain. In the town there are not
sufficient voters to give Mr. Stanley a majority—cud
ad-
mitting that there were, there is not sufficient time to poll
the electors. Mr. Stanley complains of the conduct of Mr.
Hunt's Committee, and of the persons who have supprgod
him, for the way in which they have conducted themselees
during the election. He feels that Mr. Hunt will be re-
turned, but he is certain that he will unseat him by pi.
titioning the House on the ground that improper votes
have been received, and that votes have been reseived se
vend times over. In fact, Mr. Stanley's Committee re-
present they are prepared with evidence to prove that one
man stated he had voted eleven times. The men of Pres-
ton state that Mr. Stanley cannot overturn the whole of
the votes composing Mr. Hunt's majority, and they, there'
tore, look upon his return as certain.

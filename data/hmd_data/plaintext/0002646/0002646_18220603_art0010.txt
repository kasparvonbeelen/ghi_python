" OPERA CHARITY FETE.
As a traveller, and one who wishes to see as much as Os-
of the manners and splendour of civilized nations, as well as
customs and slavery of the half wild ones, I considered the
1.:11 given last Thursday at the King's Theatre for the relief of
w Distressed Irish, one of the best opportunities that chance
al;,1 afford me to behold an assembly of the beauty and magni-
s: ze of this country, and to contribute, at the same time, to
so charitable purpose. Unfortunately, having been very re-
„oti on the Continent, I returned to England too late to pro-
oNself with a ticket of admission into the King's Theatre
:n above night. I communicated my wishes to some friends
the day before the ball was to take place, and on Thursday
torting, a person, from a respectable quarter, called at m 7,
OAK, and acquainted me that Mr. Ebers, owner of the King s
Theatre, had one hundred tickets to dispose of, and that I might
one at the price of ten guineas.
o I cid not hesitate to send for the ticket, meaning to contri-
s.L. ch..t sum to the above charity; but I am since informed
ol.ly two guineas out of ten will be applied to the relief of
tr poor; and as 1 am going out of England within a few weeks,
i.d, probably, a 10.:g time will elapse before my return, I could
ct lase the promising opportunity of satisfying my curiosity In
:ono a Ilritisi; fete for charity's sake. Accordingly I presented
at the theatre, and when half way up the stairs,-rny ticket
rat 7ric.c‘ted : it bore the name of the Countess de Grey; send,
1. : back. that of Mr. Vaughan. No sooner did I present it
to the cheek-taker than he acquainted me that I was not per-
tt d to pass tso . and in a very abrupt manner, said that I must
there: at the same time he called some one out, and two
i:e otiicers appeared, who took me into their custody ; and
that state I remained for about a quarter of an hour, exposed
i had been in a pillory) to the Public, who entered in crowds
: ale time. I will not enter on the minutia of the petty in-
fits i received, or on what I felt, for that may easily be con-
Lived front any who has feelings of honour : at last, perceiving
gentleman conversing with the officers, who kept a strict watch
ter me, as if I had committed some high treason, I requested
at he would have the goodness to be witness that I was then
trier an arrest by the police officers; be was the Earl of Ancram,
who having been informed that I had the ticket from Mr. Ebers,
sad that it was a ticket which bad been lost ; and I was unable
to conceive how it could have fallen into the hands of Mr. Ebers
L. be sold.
" At last, having given my name to the Noble Earl, he told
ire to give my ticket to him ; for which, in exchange, his Lord-
sh:F kindly offered me his own, which I accepted, and entered
fa Theatre, where, by the illusion and splendour of the scene,
boon forgot the disagreeable adventure at the door. His Ma-
jo:y had not yet entered the house, and I was waiting, with
ihoL,rauls more, for his desired appearance. Half an hour- bad
d, when not less than three Bow-street torturers, or rather,
tat f-catchers, surrounded me, and with that gentleness, which
'hey Zr', I suppose, accustomed to use to felons, I was com-
%r.ded to march out and appear before Sir Richard Birnie, who
in the Concert-room, and, with the authoritative tone with
tiich, no doubt, he addresses rogues and thieves, ordered me
I) toallr Out of the house. I attempted to address myself to him,
IA to explain ; but he s aid, " I will not hear any thing from
Sos, Sir ; you entered with a wrong ticket, and you must go out.
ts-Tscrs, do your duty—as I take upon myself to answer
a'r." And this was said with a smile, signifying,-as I thought,
tot no reproaches could be made to a person like himself for
Ciatever error he might commit.
a I must confess, that I was a little at a loss how to account
kr all this proceeding ; but could not suppose that the owner
of the Theatre himself could sell a ticket, the bearer of which
r.iro become the victim of mismanagement and bad regulations:
k.at "hat surprised me above all was, that Sir Richard Birnie,
lacing heard the question on one side, would nut hear that of
the other. Ilad Sir Richard hearkened to my defence, I would
hoe told him at once that 1 had bought the ticket from Mr.
lien, who was then in the house, and having ascertained that I
bank the ticket from him, Sir Richard would have acted right,
and all would have ended satisfactorily : but the more I attempted
rt explanation, the More peremptorily he ordered his satitites to
6 their duties. Thus I can form a pretty correct idea, at my own
expense, of the impartial administration of justice by this Gentle-
t:an. I held in my hands the ticket given to me by the Earl of An-
cram, which was snatched from my hand by one of the gentle-
r:en officers, and which ticket was also pronnuaced to be wrong.
nothing could then avert the immediate execution of turning me
tat of doors ; and even theatediation of the Lord Mayor, who
was casually present, and had signified that he knew me,
could not prevail -on. Sir Richard to examine this unpleasant
tflair, before he so hastily condemned me: yet this Gentleman
ie at the head of the police over the greatest metropolis in the
s cold ! Notwithstanding all this, I contrived to keep my place,
in hopes that the mistake would be rectified at the end.
" At this time Sir Richard was called out by some one, and
I was left'in custody of two officers, as a culprit, in the face of
that were present. On the return of Sir Richard, Mr. M.
e:tdeavoured to persuade him that I was incapable of making use
of an irregular ticket, and that I was as numb known as any one
'
' But Ido nut know him replied Sir Richard; by which
o,e-laration I felt myself highly flattered, having resided In Eng-
iota about twenty years, except the time of my journey; but it
rev great honour to the vigilance of Sir Richard, who is at
the head of the Police, and ought to know every foreigner in
"le country. Sir Richard urged, that Lords MountCharhs and
i;wydyr had acquainted hint that 1. entered the House with a
':tong ticket; but I can scarcely believe that their Lordships
,ould act so unworthily by me and by themselves, as to suppose
rate capable of making use of a wrong ticket.
" Finally, the Earl of Antram appeared, and Indio; the ticket
i.e had honoured me with was in the hands of the officer, took
it from him and returned it to me, informing Sir Richard at the
same time that Mr. Ebers declared that the ticket halbsen sold
Ly him, and that he would be answerable for it. I was then
left at large, to enjoy the fete if I could; and, having expressed-
some dissatisfaction at the ill-treatment I met, I had, in reply,
that if I had been another person I should have experienced
r.oleft worse treattntht. So much for justice. I walked about
'Le Theatre till his Majesty left it, at half-past one, merely to
myself to my friends, and then retired, much pleased with
the sight; but 1 leave the reader to consider if 1 had not reason
to be also disgusted, having met with some of the grossest ill.
eatutent that coul.. be conceived, and that, too, from these very
Psople who ought to have protected me, and whose harshaws
;And severity ought in justice to have been directed against Mr.
J.Sers, for selling me a wrong ticket—a circumstance I dull

TIIE FRENCII CLERGY.

In a new wotk concerning 4, the Errors and Prejudices spread
in the 18th and 19:h Centuries." by M. Salgues, the following
picture is drawn of the French Clergy in winding up his Essay :
At the moment I am writinx, a sort of vertigo agitAtes the
sacristies and the seminaries. The young Clergy and the new
Bishop meditate a religious revolution. Their passions are fer-
menting under the cloak of devotion, anti because Providence
has placed a religious Prince on the Throne, these men, de-
voured by ambition, say to each oche. Let U 4 profit of that mo-
ment to seise again the power which the !rightful IL volts-
don took away Irom us : let us talk of the good things of
Heaven, that we ntay recover the good things of the earth ;
let us endeavour to raise the tiara above the Crown ; let attempt
to extinguish that flame of intelligence *MA Goo himself has kin-
dled in the hearts of the people ; let us, if possible, real the dark-
ness which is dissipated among men whom fatal light has readered
averse to slavery ; let us fill their minds with vain and chimerical
dreams ; let us revive those pious frauds which our forefathers
used hi the barbarous ages ; let us astonish the ignorant and cre-
dulous inukitude with magical wonders ; let us fill the schools
with our muter. and our books only; let us mike fools and bigots
of them, and by this folly and bigotry let us become, as formerly,
the arbiters of the human race." U. Salgues, who in these words
concludes his work, knows well enough the people he has to deal
with, and is prepared for the hatred he will draw on himself :—•• I
foresee (he says) all the abuse this work will brirg on me ; I know
all the poison the language of lake devotees conceals. They have
already, on another occasion, heaped on me the most odious calm-
:des. Like the Laocoon of Virgil, I have resolved to save my
country from the scourge which it is intended to inflict upon it :
lake him, I must expect to be devoured by serpents."

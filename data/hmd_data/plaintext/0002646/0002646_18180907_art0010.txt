probity and honour, and the tnildness of his charac-
ter. Among those people the greatest tranquillity
prevails, and various tribes of wild Indians from the,
interior have entered into communication with them,
and carry on a small traffic, which, without doubt,.
will be considerably increased, when they receive the
European merchandise carried from Angostura by
some individuals front Rio Negro, in return for vari-
ous valuable productions, which have stimulated the
merchanti of this capital. It is truly deplorable,
that thetwant of proper velivels calculated for this
navigatuni, will not for skapreeent allow us to give
the necessary impulse to the relations of commerce
with a country which 'offers so many natural pro-
ductions, aud from which great advantage might be
derived to European arts and industry, to the mutual
benefit of both Continents. Then we should soon see
the great benefits of which the world has been de-
prived through the egotist indolence of the Spaniards,
their criminal monopoly, and the barbarous prohibi-
tive system, which was, carried to such an extreme,.
that the hidiarli of one mission were ~not allowed to
communicate with those of another, although they
were both•governed by the same Monks ; and Attlf,
rica is to be entailed to that slothful nation; because,
forsooth, they do not chuse to work, but retail the
labours of other people t But no, this fault does not
rest with the nation, which, deserves a better fate;
but with their Government, who, from proscribing,
strangling, or burning alive all those who dared to
think, has succeeded in depriving them of 'their in-
tellectual faculties and of all vital action, compelling
them to follow the impulse of its caprices and
imbecility.
" Spaniards of the Peninsula! Your Government
is your real enemy. We, on the contrary, arc your
natural friends :

' Un here eat nn amltionni ps la Nature.'
It is not with you we carry on the war, but with the
mercenary assassins which your Government throws
on our coasts, with the foolish project of consolidating
at the same time your slavery and outs. Threatened
with the same evils, victims of the seine oppression
and of the same tyranny, why not unite at once—why
not embrace, and be all free, and again call ourselves
brothers? Peace with Spain, and war with her 60.:
verr.mer.t, is our motto, and is the cry which now
resounds throughout America."

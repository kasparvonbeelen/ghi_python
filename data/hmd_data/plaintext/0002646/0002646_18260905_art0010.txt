ENGLISH OPERA HOUSE.

Last evening, after tlse new Farce of Before Breakfast,
which continues nightly to increase in public estimation,
we were introduced, after a twelvemonth's absence, to
our comic friend Jonathan in England. The performance of this
character by ISlevuzws last evening had all the drollery and truth
of former representations, and was (ifopossible) received with in-
creased applause. The cossic manner in which he mingles Ameri.
can liberty with Negro slavery is rich and characteristic iti the ex-
treme. The Song by him was encored, and the repetition was
varied with an excellent and pointed squib at the mania fur specu-
lation.—Beneter, as Sir Leatkrdip Grotssfeede►, supported the part
of the Alderman with his usual ability.—Suman made his 6t st ap-
pearance this season as Agamemnon, and was very favourably re-
ceived.—Kramir had nothing to do but to look very stupid—an
accomplishment in which he particularly excel.. The house was
fashionably attended, and crowded to an overflow.

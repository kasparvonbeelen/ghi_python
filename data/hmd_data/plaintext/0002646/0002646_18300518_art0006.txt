SLAVIRT.

The Bishop of BATH and WELLS presented a petition from
the inhabitants of Procne, in Somerset, fur the abolition of slavery.
The right reverend prelate felt himself upon to say, that sla-
very, so long established by chriatiant, was hostile to the law of
Gon. It was continued in the 19th century, to the great disgrace
of the Christian world, and every feeling of Christianity would be
outraged if they allowed the offspring of negrom to be slaves.
Lord DARNLEY presented a petition for removing the disabili-
ties of the Jews.

Lord OLENGALL presented a petition from Carrick against
the additional duty on spirits.

EAST IETFOID DULL.
On the motion of the Marquis of SALISBURY, counsel and
witnesses were called in, and the inquiry respecting the corrupt con-
duct of the voters of East Retford was renewed.

On this occasion their lordships adopted a new mode of examin-
ing the witnesses. A box was made for the purpose of raising them
so that the evidence of each witness might be distinctly heard.
William Barton, one of the electors who had an itching palm at
the election, was the first who occupied the box.
The examination having extended to the usual hour, further pro-
ceedings were adjourned.

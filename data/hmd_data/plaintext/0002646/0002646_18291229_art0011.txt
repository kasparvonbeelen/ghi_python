LETTER IV.
Beeoes, Sass. MISTS.
Stit,—Venezuels was the first to suffer the chastise-
ment of these errors : it is true, however, that in this
cut nature came to the aid of tyranny ! The earthquake of
1812, extended its ravages over all that was patriotic
there, cutting off the physical resources of the Re-
public, to such adegree indeed as capriciously to consume
all those which belonged to the enemy. As might be an-
ticipated, fanaticism eagerly seized hold of this event, tol
represent the catastrophe as an evident visitation from
Heaven ; new ecclesiastical censures were fulminated
against the insurrection ; the moral force being thus
destroyed, and the country wounded in her very
bosom, her power and intellectual exertions, she had only
to cover herself with a mantle of sorrow and expire I'
But she soon resncitated. Great Political convulsions
scarcely ever fail to raise a man up, capable of directing
the destinies of his country. Bolt V AR, who had com-
menced his career of glory, on the banks of the Mag-
dalena, developed on this occasion the energy of his
character. Exiled by the Congress of New Granada,
and having for his companions in arms Ruins, D'EL-
111'.S5R, JIRARDOT, and URDAN ETA , he defeated,
with a handful of brave followers, the enemy's bands
in Cucuta, the Taguanes, and at Aruare ; then hastening
to the heights of Guaire, cut off the sea from MONTE-
If ?ADZ, &AMON TO ERDEIVhO, with a ferocity not often
imitated by his countrymen, had trod under foot the
laws of nations, violated the solemn capitulation of San
Mateo, and covered Venezuela with mourning and tears.
desolating these unhappy provinces with fire and sword,
proscribing all that was patriotic an I virtuous, these
monsters renewed the horrors of the early conquest,
and forced us into acts of just reprisal.
Although reinforced by the troops which CAJIO ALI
brought from Spain, the enemy could not advance a *top,
without being encountered and beaten by RIB" URDA-
META, MONTILLA and MARI IN O. BOLIVAR, struggling
not only with the numerical superiority of his adversaries,
but against the insubordination, apathy, and discontent of •
the people themselves, (provoked by the exactions of
some of his own Lieutenants) saw himself at length be- Y 4
trayed by fortune ; and from the result of the ill-fated days "'lt
of Curs, Urica, and la Puerta, nearly the whole country II
became the theatre of the vengeance and fury of Morales. ti
Always bearing the honour and interests of his country
st heart, the Hero of Carabobe returned to New Granada,
to obtain succours for delivering Venezuela. Having by this
time heard of the return of FERDINAND to Spain, of
his Ammo Decree of the 4th of May ; the hostile mea-
sures" to be adoptell against South America, which
formed the resolution never to return to the yoke. The
Congress of Granada proved faithful to its mission. De-
spising
equally the menaces and promises of the Spanish
despot, the representatives of the people replied t•
them by decreeing an immediate levy en masts.
Santa-fe, whose President, NARINO, hall deli-
vered a portion of the South, after the glories' adieu
at Calivio,Juanambii, tuiaTacines' refused his contingent,
not to the country, but to that authority." ,But the
province of Cundinamarca having been subiltradrity Bo-
Lives it entered into the confederacy, andtlY war
was this terminated. A central government yeas *then
installed in the capital of New Granada, leaving the exe-
cutiveliptree in the hands of a triumvirate, it was re-
solved to prosecute the war with vigour.
To this effect, troops were sent to Popayan to check
the progress of the royalists, who had contrived to re:
cover their previous losses. Joining the corps of
URDANETA, charged with defending the province
Pamplona, it was decided that Bora', ea should proceed
to dislodge the Spanish forces at Santa Martha, and
thence march for the liberation of Venezuela. It already
seemed that New Granada was about to consolidate its
future independence and prosperity, when the venom
of discord was again disseminated, to threaten it
with slavery and ruin.
Actuatedby an unjust spirit of disobedience to na
authority, the representatives of Carthagena refused the
auxiliaries which were ordered to be placed at the disposi-
tion of BOLIVAR. A fratricidal contest now ensued be-
tween the troops which should have delivered Santa-
Martha, while the enemy profited by our dissemble'
to possess himself of Barranquilla and Mompos, and
of the warlike stores in these places, as well as
the slender forces we had on the Magdalena. During
the siege of Carthagena, the provisions collected in the
fortress were consumed, and the place deprived of that
assistance which it had formerly received from the inte-
rior provinces.
On the news that the worthy executor of FERDI-
NAND Vll.'s decrees had arrived at the head of a large
armament, BoLiv s s adopted one of those resolutions so
worthy of his energetic mind. He determined to ablest
himself from a country, to which circumstances rendered
it, for the moment, impossible to be useful. Exhorting the
Government of Carthagena to prepare for a vigorous resist-
ance ; and requesting that the troops hitherto under his
command might be employed against the common enemy,he
embarked for Jamaica, with the intention of waiting a more
favourable opportunity of recommencing that war which
he had from the first sworn to wage against despotism. •
When there is no disposition to listen to reason, says
Plummy, she does not fail to make her voice beard.
The whole of Venezuela having been reconquered by the
united forces of MORILLO and MORALES, the ex-
pedition disembarked at Santa-Martha, and soon after
laid beige to Carthagena, which place, with a weak
garrison, exhausted by previous attacks, closely block-
aded by land and sea, was defended with an obsti-
nacy and heroism every way worthy of the cause
it bad to sustain. Whenever the soldiers of Fan
DIN4WD attempted to reduce the city by force
of arms, they were driven back. Though struggling with
hunger and famine, a prey to pestilence and disease—
their situation aggravated by every imaginable evil, not
a voice was heard from the friends of freedom ,to
Propose a catalatioon or solicit terms form the enemy.
At the end of one hundred and sixteen days,
wben every hope of relief or successful resistance had va-
nished, the inhabitants resolved to abandon the soil under
which their forefathers slept, rather than be again sub-
jected to the hated yoke. All those who had sufficient
strength to rise from their beds hastened on board the
vessels in the bay : the emigrants broke through the
enemy's squadron, and like those of Tyre, Thew, and
Phocea 2,000 unhappy exiles went to seek an asylum in a
distant land, that might preserve them from the renewed
domination of their tyrants !
I have the honour to be, &c.

secure a more adequate representation of the people in Parliament, and
that they would shut that door which was now too wide open to
corruption. lie was convinced their Lordships were sensible that a
change in the mode of representation was now necessary. He should
think the person who could assert that the present representation worked
well, qualified for a lunatic asylum. The noble and 'emitted lord also
presented a petition from the rate.paycrs of Liverpool, praying for â€¢
system of election by ballot, and took the opportunity of making a few
observations on that specific point. It had been said he differed in
opinion upon the subject of ballot, and treated with contempt the feel.
ings of the people. His opinions on the subject had been long known ;

by ballot would not produce the effect expected.

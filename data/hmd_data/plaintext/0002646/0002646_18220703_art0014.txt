The respective objects and uses for which these Loans have
been requited, appear to be as follows:--Denmark, Prussia,
and Russia, on account of the impossibility of selling corn, their
staple article, have bent obliged to take their taxes in kind; and,
accordingly, having no vent for corn, are obliged to borrow
money. The finances of Denmark, it is well known, were left,
at the end of the war, in a very low condition; this Loan then
repairs the breach in their money market by the nun-vent for
corn, and rest ores her circulation: she requires the money this
year, and not gJuds. The same arguments apply to Russia and
Prussia. Spain, another of the contracting parties, it is needless
to remark upon; her revenues, it is well known, are altogether
ruined and ineffective for the present time, and the Loans, pro-
bably, are the only protection there against absolute bankruptcy.
Columbia and Chili restore, or rather create circulation by their
Loans, and pay off debts contracted in Europe by means of their
contracts for money here. America is in want of money (specie
disappears), and the export of funded Secutities seems to be
their present resource against the necessity of making payments
in specie. It may be as well to remark, in conclusion, that
want of money has been avowed by Portugal, and, likewise, her
great preference for the English money market.

Last night in the House of Commons Mr. Hos-
noun made his promised motion for the repeal
of the House and Window Tax, on three distinct
grounds. First, that the present amount of Taxation
was so burdensome to the people, that the House
ought to take immediate steps towards reducing
those burdens; secondly, that the benefit proposed
to be derived fiorn the maintenance of a Sinking
Fund was illusory, and that to continue to levy taxes
on die people fot the support of that fund was inex-
pedient and unjust ; and thirdly, that the Window
Tax was unjust, oppressive, and unequal in its ope-
ration. Mr. Hosnouss supported his motion by a
great variety of facts, spewing the unequal and op-
pressive nature of the tax, and by sonic incontro-
vertible arguments as to its injurious tendency on
the health and comforts of the people. The House
and Window Tax, he said, was the genuine descend-
ant in a right hue of that odious tax called Heank
snoney:yrhich was abolished by an Act of the first of
William and Mary, the preamble of which declared
" Hearth-money to be not only a great oppression
to the poorer sort, but a badge of slavery upon tie
whole people, exposing every man's house to be en-
tered into, And searched at pleasure, by persons un-
known to him ; and therefore to erect a lasting mo-

ELEcTinx INTELLIGENCE GENERALLY.

Boants—This day the election takes place at Rodmln—Davles
Gilbert and Horace Seymour, Rsqrs. will be returned.
Bosantsv—The election is fixed for Monday nest. Candidates,
J. S. Worthy, jun. Esq. and E. R. Tummy, Esq. Report says,
two other candidates are expected.
Cosies Co —The late Members will resume their seats.

Caataitorom—Mr. Mackinnon and Mr. Baring will be returned
for this borough. It is said • Mr.• Dundas has resigned. and Mr.
Sergeant Ludlow comes forward in his stead. _

gasax—A numerous deputation of freeholders returned here,
preparatory to the election for the county, on Wednesday, after
waiting on Sir Robert Wigram, Bart. at Walthamstosv House,
tiering their support in favour of one of his sons. Sir Ruben said,
if a commercial man was really wanted for the county, his ions,
who bad been tried in Parllament,were staunch against Popery and
any innovation in the Corn Laws. He would subscribe £20,000
towards the expense.
Fewer—Borne demonstrations indicative of an opposition to the
late candidates have been made by the corporator' here; but it is
very much doubted whether they will venture to take the field
against the united interests of Mr. Austen and Mr. Luck' or rather,
whether they can get any persons able to raise the ways and means,
to enter on so desperate an enterprise.
asontrusi is expected to be warmly contested ; the candidates are
Harry Baynes Lou, Esq. one of the Devon county Magistrates,
Ralph Sneyd, En. and Mr. Guest, in the iron trade, Cardiff.
Lacuna. Juni 11.—The poll is expected to commence on Tues-
day (to-day), to-morrow (Monday) being the nomination day. The
candidates are Sir Charles Abney Hastings, Mr. Otway Cave, and
Mr. Evans. There is every prospect of success to the two former.
Sir Charles's return is, however, considered certain ; he will come in
on the Corporation and True-Blue interest, and it is expected to be
a very hot contest; already the town is inundated with squibs pro
and con. Hitherto the Blues scent to have the best of it.
.

Lo•s--At Looe, all bids fair for the return of Mr. Buller's Ma-
cias, which Gentleman is clerk to the Privy Council.
Maexsozoonu—Great exertions are making in this borough to
oppose the interest of the Marquis of Aylesbury ; but we apprehend
it will be unavailable as far as regards the return of the Members
for the next Parliament.

Naserual—An attempt has been made to oppose the nominees
of the Duke of Northumberland in this place, by a canvass in favour
of Sir H. Willoughby, but it is believed the interest of his Grace
is too strong to be shaken.
Peravn—Monday is Sled for the commencement of the election
at this place. It is understood that four candidates will go to the
poll—Lord Perceval, Mr. Meaning, the Bank Director, Mr. Bar-
clay, the celebrated brewer, and Mr. Weeding. speaks
favourably of the prospects of Lord Perceval and Mri.tErctlay, but
at present It is impossible to count, with any certainty, on the issue
of the contest.

Sr. Ives—At St. Ives, so famed for party spirit, where, as in
other boroughs in the county, there have been many candidates, it
is expected that Sir Christopher Hawkins and Mr. Halle (the lat.
ter gentleman having come forward upon the invitation of the
electors, and being the last to enter the lists) will be returned with-
out opposition; the other candidates, namely, Mr. Wallis, of Sand-
hill House. Mr. William Praed, of Trevethow, and of the firm of
Praeds and Co. bankers, in Fleet-street, whose family, from their
weight of property in the borough, but which now belongs to Sir
chri.sopher, had long possessed the entire patronage, and Mr. Ste-
phens of Tregenna Castle, having successively retired from the
contest.
TOTMUL —There are three Candidates, Mr. Courtensy, Lord
Barnard, and Mr. Baldwin. There are only SS electors.
TIII•0111.- it is thought that the interest of Lord Darlington
will prove too strong for the opposition here, as at Camelford.
—Neither pains nor expense have been spared to support an
elective opposition, with what success will soon be known. Mr.
Lusbiagtim and Mr. T. Brougham, on Lord Darlington's it:wrest,
are opposed by Mr. Gordon and Mr. Mackillot—the election takes
place this day.
W 11144.—Thursday, Edwards, the new Candidate fqr the
Borough of Wells, arrived there with a few carriages of out voters,
amidst the acclamations of the people. He appeared in high spirits,
and his party are very sanguine for success. The unfortunate ill.
nem of Mt. Williams, the colleague of the above Gentleman, pre-,
vents him from being present, but Woe sent his two sons to re-
present him. The polling of the 'mere commenced ou Saturday•

Wattiscro.zo.—Tbeee wW belk- min tam.* ha". Colonel
Hughes and Cuittnel Roberts stand on the WM( hougost, which ii
eveftwhere declining. flr. Dodson, a *lend to else general policy
of Minlstets, though by no means what is called a " thick-and-thin
man," declares his opposition to the Catholic claims, and his lncli.
whin towards the abolition of slavery ; on these two points he
carries with him a large number of electors. He is the chosen
champion ; and will appear at the hustings supported by nino.tenths
of all the really independent electors of this ancient town , Colonel
Heghes, the strenuous supporter of Lord J. Russell's last motion,
will be upheld by the" most sweet voices" of these performers who
always chime in unison with that which is here calleds'lltifler's music."
—" The Miller of Wallingford" is a personage who, subsequently
to each election for Members of Parliament In that Borough, sets
out from a certain house in the town, encumbered with some tun-
dred and fifty bags, each containing twenty guineas, one of which,
without explanation, he deposits in the house of each of those
elector who may have voted for a certain candidate.

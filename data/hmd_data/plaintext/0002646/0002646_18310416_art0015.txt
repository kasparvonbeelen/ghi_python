POOR OP IRELAND.

The Earl of ROSERERIC presented a petition front the Society
tier the Encouragement of Industry, praying their Lordships to adopt
some measure for relief of the poor in Ireland. The Noble Earl
said it appeared extraordinary to him that Poor Laws were not intro-
duced to Ireland, and more particularly sn, as these laws had been
found a blessing to the poor in England. In Scotland assessments for
the poor, which might be compared to poor rates in England, had pro.
duced the greatest benefit.
The Earl of LIMERICK said, the people of Ireland would resist
the introduction of the Poor Laws. They dreaded that system as
they did the cholera morbus. The Noble Earl opposed the petition,
on the ground that it did not come from persons who understood the
interest of Ireland, but a Club in London, assembled near the Poul-
try Compter.
The LORD CHANCELLOR postponed the second reading of the
Bankruptcy bill, which stood for Monday next, until Friday.
Earl BATHURST asked a Noble Lord (Goderich) whether he
had any objection to the production of a copy of the instructions on
which the Governor-General of Canada issued a late message to the
House of Assembly.
Lord GODERICH said he should be prepared to give the Noble
Earl information on Monday.
Lord CAWDOR presented a petition from Cardigan, for Parlia-
mentary Reform.
Similar petitions were presented by the Marquis of LANSDOWNE,
from Blandon (Suffolk), Glasgow, Ayr, and Ayrshire.

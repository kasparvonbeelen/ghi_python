The Sitting of to-day has

Neuville, whose whole

publicity of the Tribune, thougs
his former colleagues might, like his own, be revealed
to France and Europe. He summoned the Minister on
all the authority of his past conduct, to repel the accu-
sation pronounced at Lisbon and London against the
acts of our late Ambassador at Madrid. He offered
him the opportunity of repelling the greatest accusation•
ever brought against a Diplomatist. M. de Neuville,
who has always fulfilled the instructions of his Court.
has refused to allow a Minister of France not to fulfil
his. These facts, on which the fate of the Peninsula
perhaps, depended, are certainly insisortant. The oc.
cupation of Portugal by an English army has been de-
nounced at the Tribune of Lisbon as the sad fruits of
the conduct of a French Ambassador. ° Consider (said
M. Villa Real), his conduct must not be confounded
with that of his Government." The Baron de Damao
who had taken notes during the speech of M. de Neuville,,
did not mount the Tribune to disavow either the con-,
duct of the Ambassador inculpated, or the reproach of
having yielded to conditions which it is of importauca
France should know that it has not.

What will be thought of this discussion ? Do oar
Ministers hope that the budget for ecclesiastical affairs
has already caused it to be forgotten? No ! France will-
thank M. de Neurille for having required esplanaAions
which it expeited, without departing from the reserve
which the former functions imposed on him. It will be
grateful to him for his efforts to throw light on a gres•
tion which is sought to be left obscure; but if it does.
justice to him who has spoken, It will perhaps judge
severely of those who thought it their duty to be silent.

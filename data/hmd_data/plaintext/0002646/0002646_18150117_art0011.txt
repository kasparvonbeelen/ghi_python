THE GALLIC SLAVE

I IP.

The Slave Ship, deep laden, rides o'er the Atlantic :
The sons of proud Gaul in their fortune rejoice;
Whilst many a Negro, by grief render'd frantic,
Calls loudly on death, as the doom of his choice.
Beneath those white sails, which the winds are impelling
Too swift to the isles where curia slavery reigns,
The breast of the maiden with sorrow is swelling—
The heart of the lover is bursting its chains.
For (mark, ye proud Christians !) in sable skin shrouded,
Beats many a heart that is gentle and kind;
And many a bright eye with sorrow is cleuded,
Which once beatied benevolence, spirit, and mind.
Oh! shame on that Ration; humanity yielding,
And curse on the wretches who, sordid and vain,
(No ray of remorse or compassion e'er feeling)
Would barter the blood of their fellows for gain.
And ye, mighty Monarchs, whose conquering legions
Deliverance for Europe with glory have gaited,
Extend now the olive to those torrid regions,
Where, torn from his country, the Negro is chalti'd.
And thou, happy Britain, whose firm perseverance
Resealed the Boy RBON, defended thine own,
Who first in the struggle, yet first in forbearance,
When once the Usurper was hurl'd from his throne.
Bar woe to that treaty which tarnish'd thy glory—.
Which " let slip" the war hounds on Africa's coast ;
And infamy light on the karden'd and hoary,
On whom are thy lessons, Adversity, lost!
But thou, 0 ALMIGHT ! without whose permission
No sparrow can fall, nor yet tyrant oppress,
Incline to the pray'r of each Briton's petition,
And quickly the wrongs of the Negro redress !

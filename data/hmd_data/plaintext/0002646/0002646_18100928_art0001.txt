the weaknesses connected with. it. No medicine possesses puds
general restorative palitles, or so well adapted to every class of
valetudinarians;. the cold' nerves and weak muscles of relaxed
habits are Warined, animated, and confirmed; by them the limbs
acquire freak vigour, the exhausted veins are filled with rich and
healthy juices, the spirits drooping add languid, become revived
and exhilrated, the different functioas of appeti to and digestion
art promoted by it, a d the whole concitution receives new life
and strength. This grand restorative of health cannot be recoils.

Under these obligations, his only desire Seems tti be
to oppose himself to the interest of the natives, and
uniting himself with the Spaniards, to use hisusmost
endeavours to render useless the steps that that! fwet

and to involve these colonies in all the miierieiratd*

" As a reward for such services, Liniers has !wed
dignified with the title of Duke of Buenos Ayres, by
his patron and friend Napoleon. There is no doubt
that he will be punished for his ingratitude; in the
mean time he is spreat:ing the seeds of discord, and
calling upon the people of Buenos Ayres to recollect
the injuries they have received from the English na-
tion, and the impossibility of maintaining friendship
with a Government of which they have so lately ex.
perienced the injustice.
4. These scandalous procikdings of the Generals
and of the Spaniards, who fear being deprived of a
monopoly they have enjoyed for three centuries, have
not, impeded the Revolution in the various territory
of the Viceroyalty ; in the 'kingdom of Santa Fee; is
that of Chareas, Paraguay, the provinces of Lnegas,
in the districts of Vraquai, Parana, Mendosas and
Maldonado. In aleptliese places the new Govern.
went has been acknowledged with transpost and ap.
plause, * the means by which they have been deli-
, vered from slavery, and restored to the honourable
ring of freemen.
It is impossible to describe in adequate terms the
delight which these events have occasioned among
the various tribes of the interior, and particularly
among the native Indians, to whom, lustier the near
order, are conceded some of the rights of Cidaenship,
to relieve them from the darkness and contempt to
which they have been so long consigned. These na-
tives signify their joy by feasts, dance, and songs, in
which they celebrate the valour of their ancient
Chiefs, and the tragic doada of their Incas, sacrificed
to Spanish ambition, under the cloak of Christianity.

FROM THE MONITEUR OF REPT. 14.
ON MI CINDUCT o ?HZ INGLISII IN SPAIN AND 1(011-
TVGAIO--FlRrr oven.
" General Moore with 25,000 men excellent mops,
did nothing in November, 1808, for the Spaniards.—
Spain, nevertheless, had then 300,000 men- under

arms, and all her troops of the line.• The head quer-

ters of the French were at Victoria. Bilboa was oc-
. copied by the Spanish army of Gallicia, 8000 strong;
the army of Estrernadura, cbnsisting of 30,000 men,

possessed Burgos ; 86,000 men commanded by Cas-
tanos, were in Tudela, independently of the armies
which defended the passage of the Samo Sierra to the
-Guadarama, We do not mention Catalonia.
If " Peneral Moore arrived at Salamanca in the month
oaf September, and remained there all November, an
idle spectator of the destruction of the Spanish armits
of the first line; of the battles of tspenosa,
_Burgos:
and Tudela. The French army advanced upon Val-
ladolid and Aranda, he remained immovable, suffer-
ing the Samo Sierra to be forced, and Madrid taken,
without advancing a step.

" Eight days after he knew that Madrid vras taken
.—that the Spanish armies were destroyed and driven
back into Andalusia, he put himself in motion from
Salamanca, and marched with an intentiOnnf threat-
ening the corps of the Duke of Dalmatia; but soon
discovering the snare into which he had fallen, the
wreck of his army shamefully embarked at Corunna,
.after abandoning his artillery, caissons, ammunition,
and hospitals. It appeared that he arrived in Spain
for no other purpose, than that of witnessing the de-
stract'on of the Spanish armies, of the first and se-
ccind line.

,f If General Moore had marched either to Espe-
nosa to sustain Blake, or to Burgos to assist the army
of Estremadura, or to Tudela to support Castanos,
-conqueror or conquered he would have discharged his
duty like a friend and ally.

4g If he had marched upon Samo Sierra, or Guada•
rama, he would have covered Madrid, given time to
'organize the defence of that capital, he would have
rallied the wrecks of the Spanish troops, and whether
he succeeded or not, he would have tried his fortune
with honour. The insurgents would then have owed
gratitude to the English, and would not be justified
sn their complaints.

" But it is a fatality attached to the English arms,
that they are never useful to their Allies. General
Moore was not of more service to the Spanish cause,
which was then decided for ever, than he was to that
of Sweden, when he saw taken under his eyes the
Isles of Aland, Sweaborg and all Finland, he assisted
in the ruin of the Swedish armies ;. lie came to Spain
to assist in ruining the Spanish armies, this is what
posterity will sarof the great english Expedition.
" SIMON D Erncn.The war of the fifth Coalition
broke out on the Continent. This moment appeared
favourable for carrying on the afFairs of Spain with
activity. The French Cabinetiknew this so well that
* had the audtcity to enter upon this war without
drawing a single man from the army of Spain, with
Ihe exception of the Imperial Guard. By this means
the 11403 of the English were frustrated. Nevertheless
if there ever was a time at which they could hope to
gain the ascendancy i Spain, it was when Lord Wel-
lingtun arrived at Lisbon.

at The Duke of Dalmatia, who was at Oporto, felt
the impossibility of contending with 16,000 men
against 21.,00Q English: The Portuguese insurrec-
tion and that of the Spanish insurrectionary bands for
the French armies in Spain, without direction re-
mained isolated, or did not take advantage of the ad-
vantages which their discipline and experience ought
to have afforded them ; they did not assist each other,
but rmained inactive.

" Portugal was evacuated without a contest or a
battle—there was too great a disproportion in num-
bers. Europe then expected that the English would
present themselves with honour, and in an imposing
manner, upon the Continental Theatre ; that thirty
or 35,000 men, sent from England, would have join-
ed Wellington's army, consisting of 25,000, and to-
gether formed an army of from 50 to 60,000 men,
which it was supposed England could bring into the
field, and that these, united to the wreck of the Por-

tuguese army anti Spanish insurgents, and supported
by the gold of Mexico and Perti,.would have formed
an imposing force. The English, faithful to their
system, sent no reinforcements to Lord Wellington,:
Who, afar operations the most inconsiderately undef-
taken, and in the most perfectkporanee of the force
of the enemy, escaped by a miracle from-entire de-
xtrin. tion atter the battle of l'ilaverat but lost his
b)-pitals, and fell back upon Lisbon to recruit his
army. Atter havi,ng seen half the Spanish army
which feitgbi with him destroyed, he evacuated Spain
precipitately, and with as little reflection as he entered
It. During this time 50,000 other Eitglish arrived to
perish in the marshes of Walcheren.

" Thus in this second epoch of the war in Spain
the English have constantly studied to avoid every
tang which would have compromised their safety,
:and to do only what was necessary to excite people,
and foment a civil war. If they compromised them-
selves for a moment, it was through inconsiderateness,
er a shanieful ignorance of war.-
. " SheTtly After, Seville and Andalusia were taken
from de Spaniards, and that Junta, so dearly allied to
.the King of England, was driven into the fortifica-
tions of (`:oiz, without the terrible General Welling-
ton making a single movement to s.nccour them, or
_ attempting a diversion in favour of Seville, the list
b pe of the insurrection.
• " Twat) i.rocti.z-At-this third epoch of the war
in opam, t.,e Continental repose being•fixed by the
peace of Vienna, all sensible men and friends of hu-
inanity expected, (ha since England had not known
- bow to profit by the war 44 the fifth coalition, and
had been so ill informed of the state of affairs as to
send 30,000 men to perish in the marshes of Walche-
. ren.in place of employing them in driving the French
from -Spain, she would have felt that her true interest
o reuse from that -theatre, and not to npuder
herself any longer guilty of the blood which sl.e

caused to be sled, and of the
mitted, and endeavour to pre
the integrity of Spain, which
great advantage to her.
time the Marquis Wellesley
man, ignorant of European
them by the principles of polii
practice in India, caused the King of
enter into an engagement to support and acknow-
ledge the insurgents, to do that which General Moore
had not been able to do when the force and power of
the insurrection was at its height; and that which Lord
Wellington was not able to accomplish when the
French armies were at .Vienna and in Hungary. He
thought at least that England should make great ef-
forts—should have a considerable army in Portugal,
and that supported by the fortresses of Ciudad Ro-
drigo and Almeida, she should profit by the embar-
rassment which the siege of those two places would
cause the French, to give them battle. It was, how-
ever, otherwise, the English army was but feebly re-
inforced, and in place of action, contented itself with
boastings and bravadoes.. Ciudad Rodrigo was in-
vested—Romana and the Spanish Colonels ran from
the farthermost parts of Estramadura, and with tears
in their eyes, threw themselves. at the feet of Lord
Wellington, conjuring him to succour the brave gar-
rison.of Ciudad Rodrigo, where 8000 chosen troops
were shut up. (

46 Lord Wellington, who promised every thing,
when the question was to shut up the SOOO men in
the 'place, retreated when it was needful to act, and
went so Far as to shew in full Council a letter from
the King of England, which forbade him to hazard
any thing. The fortress of Ciudad Rodrigo was taken
and 8000 chosen Spanish troops in it made prisoners.
Upon this intelligence the English asserted, that the
same should not happen to Almeida, and persuaded
the Portuguese to enclose themselves in that place.
But what purpose will it answer, said the Portuguese,
to shut up ourselves in Almeida, since the French
have all the requisites for a siege ? If you will not
give them battle, blow up the tortiess ! If you in-
tended to succour it, why have you not given the ex-
ample at Ciudad Rodrigo ? The case is different,
said Lord Wellington, I had contrary orders respec-
ting Spain—l have none such for Portugal. Besides,
I could not engage in the plains of Ciudad Rodrigo
against a cavalry five times the number, and better
appointed than mine ; but Almeida is in a country
intersected with rocks. When the fortress has been
besieged, and the French fatigued with the siege,
I will relieve if. The garrison must allow itself to
be shut up in the place."
General Craufurd, by the most foolish mancenvres,
caused the regiments of his division to be completely
defeated. The trenches were opened before Almeida,-
the English from their camp witnessed the fire from
them. The Portuguese came to Lord Wellington,
and demanded that he would keep his promise and re-
lieve their countrymen. • I can do nothing, (he re-
plied) my orders are contrary.' A few days after,
Almeida was taken. It is reported that, on this Oa.
casion, a Portuguese General said to Lord \Veiling-
ton, • If you cannot defend us, why incite us to re-
sistance and cover with ruins and blood our unfoitu-
nate country ? If you are in sufficient force, give
battle ; if you are too weak, and cannot bring greater
forces, retire, and let us arrange matters with the
conquerors.'

" As his only answer, Lord 'Wellington sounded
a retreat, and by a barbarity unknown among civi-
lized nations, ordered that the mills, farms and houses
should be destroyed, and that a vast desert should
separate by many. marches the English and French
armies. This conduct is atrocious, and without ex-
ample in modern annals. The Turks and Tartars
alone act thus.

BANKS OF THE MAYNE, SEPTEMBER IG.
The Imperial Decree which lately appeared in
France, by which the different political journals pub-
lished in the Departments were placed under the in-
spettion of the Prefects, has given occasion to a simi-
lar order from chi Count Von Wolfradt, the West-
phalian Minister for the Home Department, with re-
ference to Westphalia-- The Journals and Gazettes
are, in every department, placed under the inspection
and censorship of the Prefect, who is to take care
that nothing appear in them which may compromise
the interests of the kingdom of France and her alliei,
and particularly those of the German confederation.

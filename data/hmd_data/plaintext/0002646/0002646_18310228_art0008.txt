LONDON.
MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28.

What a glorious display of public spirit and good intelli-
gence, in the British people, took place in the House of
Commons on Saturday ! Several hundred eloquent and
energetic petitions, signed by half a million of people, in
favour of Parliamentary Reform, and the great majority for

LORD ALTHORP did justice to his public character by

which Lord John Russell is the organ to develope. we
propose to print a Special Edition of the STAR, whatever
be the hour at which his statement closes; and we give
this timely notice of our intention to the London Public,
while we propose to dispatch the same to Agents in all the
Great Towns, so as to anticipate the post of the following
evening.

We regard the welfare, and even the very existence
of the country, as identified with the success of the measure,
and conclude that tens of thousands must feel as we do.—

It will be an emancipation from slavery to corrupt masters, to
that state of Freedom, which is the birth-right of all men,
and the special inheritance of Briton..

Much has been said about the family predilections of
Earl GREY— we presume by those who are either too

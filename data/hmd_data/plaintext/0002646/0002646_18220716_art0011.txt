FRANKFORT, JULY 8.

Just as our Paper is going to Piess, we receive
accounts from Vienna of the 4th instant: the Metal-
liques had risen to 79 9.16, and the Bank Shares to
775. The cause assigned for this extraordinary rise
is, that the Bank will henceforward discount for four
per cent. instead of five, as it has hitherto done. The
Bank purchased on that day 300,000 florins in the
live i.er Cent. Metalliques, in the course of the day,
for its reset ve fund.

SALONICIII, MAY O.

Several villages of Mount Olympus have taken no
part in the revolt, and have remained quiet. The
Pacha, at the head of about 15,000 men, has exe-
cuted justice on the others that took up arms. And
what justice was this? All the men who could not
escape into the mountains have been cut to pieces ;
ail the women and children that could be found have
been reduced to slavery. The little town of Niausta
has been totally deAroyed by fire, notss ithstanding
tlte orders of the Paella, who was unable to check
the fury of his troops. Some Greek villages were
burnt by the Insurgents themselves because the inha-
bitants would not join them ; and some of the armed
Greeks had the batbwous courage to massacre their
Nvives and childten with their own hands before they
took flight.
MAY 11.—All is quiet towards Niausta ; but it is
the stillness of the tomb. Our Paella has returned,
with the greater putt of his ;tally.
Yesterday they brought in the head of the famous
Chief Zafit2ki, and that of Captain Dacis. At the
same time forty•nine Greeks were brought in, who,
after having formed part of the corps of these Chiefs,
flei into the mountains. They were immediately
beheaded.

TETITIONS FOR THE ABOLITION OF COLONIAL SLAVIIM

NIL BROUGHAM presented 385 petitions for the abolition of co-
lonial slavery ; 128 were from different parts of Yorkshire, 83 from
Suffolk and Sussex, and others from several dissenting congregations.
On presenting them he remarked that the prayer of the petitions had
his most hearty concurrence, and would have his zealous support; and
should, by any calamity, his efforts fail, he was confident that there
would be, soon after, twenty petitions for one on the same subject; and
if these failed, that the failure would be attributed to the constitution
of the house, and the petitions for reform would accumulate ten-fold.
The petitions, which formed an CTIOTMOUS pile, were laid on the table.

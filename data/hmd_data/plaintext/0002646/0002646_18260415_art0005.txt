PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS.
HOUSE OF LORDS, Asap. 14.
The Duke of NORTHUMBERLAND presented a Petition
from certain Shipholders resident in Soo* Shields, in the County
of Durham, praying for ?protecting Dotins.—Laid on the table. -
• ABOLITION 01 SLAVBRY:
Earl GREY presented a Petition from Darlington, praying for
the Abolition of Slavery in our West India Colonies. Also similar
Petitions from Coggersl4ll, in the North Riling of Yorkshire, and
from 'a Parish in East Lothian.—Laid on the table.

Earl DUDLEY and WARD begged to call the at-
tention of their Lordships to a Petition which he held
in his hand, from the Bard of Council and House of
Assembly in !he Island of Antigua. He certainly
thought the inhabitants of that island were good au-
thority for all that concerned the slave population, for
he believed that as regarded their condition, both phy-
sical and moral, the slaves of Antigua were better off
than the slaves of any other of the West India Islands;
and would bear an advantageous c"mparison with the
free blacks in any country. The Petitioners indulged in
expressions which, perhaps, would be considered ton
harsh against a certain body of persons in this country,
who were known as Abolitionists. Whilst he ackir..w.
'edged that some of the expressions used in the Petition
may be considered harsh, he thought it just to observe
that the Colonists themselves had been the objects of
unmeasured invective; and it was not to be wondered'
at if they had not confined themselves within proper
bounds, when speaking of their opponents. Nothing
contained in the Petition was half as violent, however,
as expressions applied to the Colonists by the anti-61a-
! very party in this country. As far, however, as re-
garded their Lordships, the Petition was perfectly
resifectful, and only desired to impress upon their minds,
th it if any measures injurious to their interests were
brought forward by this country, the Petitioners would look for
indemnity. He concurred in this part of the Petition—it was but
fair that in proportion to the degree of injury sustained should be
the compensation awarded. At least, if an experiment was to be
made, the experimentalists ought to bear the danger of it. He did
not speak on his own account, being but a small owner of property
in those Wands. The Petition, which proposed that this country
should take the Island into their own hands, was not likely to be
attended to, as far as regarded the Island of Antigua; but in the
smaller islands there was a 'strong probability that the prayer of
the Petition could be complied with.
The Earl of LIVERPOOL apprehended that, in point
of form, the Petition could only be received as coming
from the Speaker of the House of Assembly. This was
a matter of Parliamentary discussion, which he should
be glad-to have settled. No doubt the Colonial As-
semblies should have some means of stating their griev-
antes. It was most important that they should have
such means, if it was admitted, as no doubt it was,
that the Legislature of this country had the right of legislating for
the Colonies. He did not wish to press the matter to an imme-
diate decision; but he thought the consideration one of importance.
After a few observations from the Earl of Launsaast.s and Vis-
count Matvitu, upon the question of form,
Lord CALTHORPE rose, and claimed the attention
of their Lordships, whilst he offered a few observations
in reply to the Noble Lord who presented the Petition.
He said the Colonists, by their own arts, and by the
resistance which they bad offered to the measures of
Government, had brought down heavier reproaches and
more obloquy on themselves than had been heaped on
' them by any party in this country, Persons in this
country were justly warranted in throwing odium on
the Colonists, until they acted conformable to reason
and the principles of humanity. The charges made
against the Abolitionists were altogether unfounded.
The Noble Lord charged them with desiring a sudden
and precipitate change : but he (Lord Calthorpe) believed, if the
language of the Abolitionists was examined, it would be found that
they had uniformly advocated measures which should be brought
into operation gradually. The Colonists were amenable for
the dreadful height of iniquity which was no* to be found prevail-
ing in the Colonies, sad he (Lord Calthorpe) would be glad, and
would be the first td hail it, if they could come forward and clear
themselves from the reproaches showered upon them, In a manner
more satisfactory to the House than they had yet done.
Lord DUDLEY and WARD explained. He said
that the anti-slavery party were liberal in their reproach..
es, and that this produced retorts from the Colonies.—
As to the second charge, that a portion of the Abolition-
ists pressed for a sudden change, he did not think it
unfounded. The Noble Lord (Calthorpe) himself was
reported to have expressed his desire that the abolition should take
place during the life time of a celebrated public character (Mr. Wil-
berforce) who, it is well known, was advanced in years. If an
abolition should take place before the death of this eminent man,
he (Lord Dudley and Ward) thought himself warrantsil in saying
it would be a sudden abolition.
Lord CA LTHORPE explained. He had never used
the expression imputed to him. At a meeting of the
Anti-Slavery Society, soon after the retirement of Mr. Wilberforce,
he had said, that even before that illustrious man's death, he hoped
he may see a visible and satisfactory approach made to a final abo-
lition, and by such a pro'pect, enjoy that reward of his labours
which was yet withheld from him.
( We understand, that at the suggestion of the LOSD CHANCELLOR,'
the Petition was finally ordered to be referred to a Committee, to
consider the point of form referred to by the Earl of Liverpool).

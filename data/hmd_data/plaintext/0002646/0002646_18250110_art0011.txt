CATHuLIC RENT.

A Meeting took place last night (Sunday 1), in the
Catholic School, in Dean-street, Soho, in furtherance of
the fund known in this country and Ireland by 4, The
Catholic Rent."

Mr. Borisov, a Banister, presidsti over a numerous
assembly, and stated the objects of their present meeting,
inviting, as we learnt, men of all religious denominations
to come, not only to their open public meetings, but to
become members of a Commiitee then forming, or be
present at every sitting of that Committee for the great
object they had in view.
At the close of the business•of the evening, the sum
of 5L 6s. sd. was announced as the amount of sub-
scriptions. And a Gentleman, whom name we could
not learn, congratulated the Meeting on this infant
proof of what might be expected, even in a small way,
from individual exertion. The account from the
speaker was very favourably received, and it was an-
nounced that from time to time the Committee would
meet to consult on the best means of forwarding the
objects of the present Meeting.

We are infornied, by a letter received from an Officer
of his Majesty's ship Tattaa, 28, Captain Conon.:
Barman, Cs& that the sudden sailing of that ship
from England, with sealed orders, in February last,
was occasioned by its being detern.ined by Government
to colonise Melville Island. The TAMAR arrived at the
Cape of Good Hope on the &h of June, but it being
necessary to refit her, she did not leave that place until
the 18th of July..--She ajived at Sydney (New South
Wales) after as excellent passage of forty-seven days
from the Cape, where Capt. Banta* hired two trans-
ports, and they took on board 8) rank and file of soldier,
and a number of the most riotous of the convicts, and
sailed for Port Essington, in Melville Island, which is
in the Gulph of Carpentaria, at the North end of New
Holland.--The TAMAR will leave the detachment of
Royal Mat ines, which she embarked at Plymouth, as a
Garrison at Port Essington.—The TAMAR afterwards
proceeds to England, calling at the Presidencies At C
eutta and Madras, for dispatches and mails. Melville
Island is well situate for: the encouraging of trade and
communication with the Malays.
We have received Madrid Papers to the 28th ultime.

deemed a sufficient support.

h.it authoritative information on these grounds
not be obtained, is much to be regretted. I might
eat, however, to proclamations of the executive
hotity at Guadeloupe, and those of Toussaint, as
11 as of the Commissioners and Agents of the
inch Government at St. Domingo, in further proof

I allude here to papers with which yon, Sir, and

14 the Negroes in an English West India Island, could
" only be considered as an impertinent interference
" with the authority of the Master, and the interior
"discipline of his plantation; as a reflection on the ac-
" tivity of the drivers, and a cruel- mockery of the
" Slaves."

The above account, given by Mr. Stephen, has been
upwards of twenty years before the public, and, so far
as I know, never has been confuted by any writer. I ,
do nut, therefore, now enter on the task of correcting ,
the errors into which he has fallen, respecting wages,
and their effect on industry, from any other motive
than that of submitting accurate statements of facts,
without which the public must remain in that delusire
which imperfect and erroneous statements have created.
It is not necessary to shew the exact amount ,df error
in Mr. Stephen's opinion of the diminished amount of
exports, or the loss sustained by the Proprietors of the
soil by emancipation, as he himself speaks with uncer-
tainty as to the correctness of his own data; but it is
singular, that the author of War in Disguise, should
have omitted to state how much the exports from Gua-
deloupe in neutral vessels were swelled, during the pe-
riod of emancipation, by the cargoes of English vessels
captured, and carried into Guadeloupe, during the go-
vernment of Victor Hugues, for such a fact directly
bore on the quantum of industry exerted by the free
Negroes. The reason of such omission may be found,
perhaps, in Mr. Stephen not thinking it important
with reference to the general argument of his able
work. It is now, however, necessary to supply
this omission, and shew what was the real state of
Guadeloupe, during the period of Victor Hugues, as to
productive industry in agriculture. I shall first give
an extract from Colonel Boyer Peyreleau, who had
long served on the Staff of the French army in the West
Indies, and who actually commanded the troops in
Guadeloupe in 015, and published, so lately as 1828,
the work from which I quote :—" Apres l'expulsion des
" Anglais, toute trace d'opposition se trouvant effacite
" par la mort des colons pus au camp de Berville, ou
" par la Nice de la majeure partie des proprietaires que
" la terreur expatria, et qui allereet porter aux Iles
" voisines, surtout a la Martinique, ua sur crolt de bras
" et de biens, un nouvel ordre de choses s'ktablit a la
" Guadeloupe. La colonie etait dans le plus gran
" ditlabrement ; les negres, igares par le decret du 16

" &veleta des pretensions, et sc reunirent au guarder

"tear assigner. Il les reconnut pour Frsnsais, mais
" rien de plus. II substitua a l'ancienne servitude une
" discipline militaire, dent la rigueur fat le correctif de
"la license des lois revolutionnaires. Les blancs, les
Bens de couleur. et les noirs furent indistinctement
" ranges sous sa domination, et les infractions furent
" ponies sans difference de couleur, et de condition.
" Tout tremblait sons la mime loi ; la mise en surveil-

" lance de tons les parens d'emigies, les commissions
militaii es, k fatal instrument peon trainait dons tour
" les quartiers, frappant, et Inenarant toutes les totes qui
" auraient youlu s'elever, fletrirent, glacarent toils les
" el:curs, et firent rentrer dans la fouls ce qui aurait,
" pre tendre a s'en detacher. Ce despoti,me n'etait point
" tardo par les qualites seduisantes d'un Pisibtrate ; un
" cynisme &vacant en accroissait l'horreurs. La
" Guadeloupe n'olfrit plus l'aspect d'une colonie Fran-
" raise; elle devant une sorte de puissance, isolee au
milieu des mers, ne conservant le nom Fransaise que
" pour le faire redouter."

Such was the system of government at Guadeloupe,
coercing every one to perform what Victor Hugues
wished to be done. To annoy the English, and capture
their vessels, formed one of the most important objects,
and the result is thus stated:." De nombreux corsaires,
bravant les quarante vaisseaux, ft egates et corvettes
" Britanniques qui les poursuivaient dans toutes ces
" men, desolerent le commerce Anglais, enlevirent ou
" briderent plus de 150 batimens jetirent sur les habi-
" tations une grande quantite de napes, pris a bord
" des haiimens enneinis qui veaaient d'en faire la traite .
sur les cotes d'Afrique, et conduisirent de vive force,
" dans les ports de la colonic, les navires des Etats-Unis
" d'Amerique qui refusaient d'y apporter leurs denrees.
" Les lieges qui n'etaient pas soldats ou marina,
" furent contraints de cultiver ks terres. Les revenue
" des biens sequestres, des habitans absents, furent
" verses dans le tresor public. Ces biens montaient
66 plus de huit cents millions de livres du pays; ks denries
" coloniaks, prises aux Anglais, ou confisquees; furent,
expediees cn France, en grande quantite."
That the comparative prosperity of Guadeloure dur-
ing the freedom of the Negroes, did not in any consider-
able manner arise fiom 'their voluntary exertions in
agriculture under the stimulus of wages, or a share in
the crop, as is supposed by Mr. Stephen, is proved by
authorities to which he had not access when he wrote;,
and among them is the statement of the value of the
prizes captured, during the wart from the English, by
the Guadeloupe privateers, amounting to fifty millions
of livres. Colonel Boyer says: " La course se fit alors
64 avec eclat, et entretint le commerce dans une sorte
" de splendeur qui, bien que factice et temporaire, sup-
"plied au dOcit qua rabsence des institutions coloniales
46 avait cause dans ks productions du Sol."
Hitherto, nothing appears to shew that wages bad
been found a sufficient stimulus to induce the free Ne-
groes to cultivate the sugar plantations, to the mutual
benefit of themselves and the Proprietors, as AricLua
maintains would be the case, were the Negroes eman-
cipated : nor does it appear that the account given of
the state of Guadeloupe, under Victor Hogue', by Mr.
Stephen, was founded upon correct information. Should
the authority of Col. Boyer be doubted, I shall submit
to the Reader extracts from the official report of Ge-
neral Desfourneaux (who immediately succeeded Victor
Hugues as Governor) dated 28 Pluvoise, An 8. Pre-
vious to the perusal of which, however, it is necessary
for the Reader to bear in mind that General Desfour-
neaux had served in St. Domingo under Southonax and
Polverel, was a realous friend to the emancipation of
the Negroes, and is officially reported by the Members
of a special Committee, 11 Ventose, An 5, to the Exe-
cutive Directory, as " possedant ,la confiance de Sou-i
" thonax."
" A mon arrive i ]a Guadeloupe," says General
Desfourneaux, " ou j'ai remplace le Cin.VictorHugues,
j'ai fait arrater sur-le-champ les etats de situation de
' " hi Colonic : die se trouvait dans la position la plus ma-
" thereuse sans arpnt dans les caisees, sans com-
" merce, awl:culture,' &c. &c.
General Desfourneaux, speaking of facts which he
had personally observed, says " En faisant ma tour-
" nee, je houvai par tout la plus projoude macre, toutes
44 les habitations minks anus les Regimes de Sequestres,
o touter les femmes proprikaire recluites au plus ?fateful,

" dennement, sans pain, et mime sans haillons pour
" couvrir kurs enfans:
This description may be compaied with that already
given by Colonel Malenfant, of the situation of the
white Proprietors of the plantations in Cayenne, during
the freedom of the Negroes there.
General Desfourneaux continues to tell us, during
this state of distress for the ``white Proprietors, that
" Les Villes etaient encombrks des cultivateurs fai-
de `.means; partout le vol, et le brigandage se succedaient
" et restaient impunis.”
The measures taken by the Governor shew the state
in which the colony must have been under Victor
Hugues Je fisai, par un arrive," says General Des-
fourneaux, 41 le-domicile respectif stir les habitations ;
j'ordonnai a tons les cultivateurs des deux sexes de
" retourner sur les manufactures, oh ils avoient prig
" naissance ; je n'autorisai a rester clans les villes que
" les citoyens de toutes les couleurs qui avaient un errs,
" ou une condition qui pouroient les faire vivre, je
donnai l'ordre d'arreter clans route la colonie les cut-
" tivateurs rencontris, sans laisses.passei des Oran:,
" oat piopristaires," &c.
Even on the arrival of General Desfourneaux, be
found 66 un grande nomble de cultivateurs s' etaient
"retires dans les boix de la Gouyave, ou ils etaieot
" voleurs, ou marrons ; je fis marcher," says he,

" mensongers annoncant que les Russes avaient envahi
66 une partie da territoire de la Republique, firent re-
" commencer la divagation, commdtre beaucoup de cols
" dans ks villes, et de brigandages sur lea routes."
The reason here assigned for the conduct of the
Negroes, in abandoning their agricultural labours to
steal and plunder, because in Guadeloupe false rumours
were spread, that Russia had invaded a part of France,
in 1799, shews that when men are under the strong in-
fluence of a favourite idea, how difficult it is for them to
form sound inferences in examining the connection be-
tween cause and effect. The result of the measures taken
by the General was finally as unsuccessful as the result
of those taken by his predecessor. He was afterwards
sent from the island of Gaudeloupe, by the Civil and
Military Authorities placed under him and the system
Slavery was finally re-established in that island,
alter a short, but bloody struggle, the details of which
would be foreign to this enquiry.
Hitherto sin trace. have been discovered of that
system of Victor Hogue:, to which Mr. Stephen re-
ferred, when be told us that the system of remunerat-
ing the emancipated Slave in Gaudeloupe was'
" speedily improved by Victor Hugues into an allow-
" ante, either by way of commutation or advance,
66 payable periodically to each labourer; and this he
4,riginally fixed at such a number of livres Aweek, as,
" considering the great scarcity of specie in the colony,
"was a tolerably ample subsistence,l think itwas 9 Livros.*
I have carefully . examined all the laws issued in
Gaudeloupe during that period, but I have been un-
able to find any such regulation as that fixing the
money wages of agricultural labour to the free Negro.
It must indeed, be obvious, that such a measure could
scarcely be effected by legislative regulations, in as
much as the wages of labour must be regulated by the
principles of supply and demand; except, perhaps, in
those countries where the market price of labour is
lower than the natural price, which last, as is well
known, depends on the price of food, necessaries, and
conveniences required for the support of the labourer
and his family. Now, the fertility of the soil in Gau-
deloupe was such, that a small portion of labour would
produce the means of subsistence, and the natural rate
of wages would therefore be low. In point of fact,
however, the free Negroes could not generally be in-
duced to work voluntarily, although the law allowed
them a portion of the crop resulting From their own
labour, equal to one fourth of the amount, (not one
third), after the expenses of the estate had been de-
ducted. This one fourth share was afterwards divided
amongst the labourers, according to their claim;
founded on their personal exertions, talents, &c.
In the case of domestics (the result of whose labour
could not be represented by productions created, and
therefore could not be thus divided), there was a re-
gulation fixing their wages; but from the day the re-
gulation was published, it was found to be imprac.
ticable; and it was only 4i livres a week for the ablest
negro, which is one-half the sum mentioned by Mr.
Stephen. _ _

Having now shewn, in the case of St. Domingo,
where the Proprietors were destroyed, or expelled, that
the free Negroes,who succeeded to these properties,were
unable to induce their fellow-countrymen, when free,
to cultivate the sugar estates for such wages as would
enable the Proprietor to derive any adequate profit from
laud, buildings, and machinery, of which be had gotten
possession, even without the transference of capital.
Having also :hewn that in Cayenne, where the white
Proprietors were not disposse)sed of their lands, build-
ings, and machinery, and where, on the authority of an
author favourable to emancipation, a low market price
of wages existed, yet that the white Proprietors were as
unable as the black Proprietors of St. Domingo to culti-
vate profitably the sugar cane, and though they had
capital in lands, buildings, and machinery, they could
only exist in the same manner as their former Slaves.
Having also strewn that the opinions entertained as
to the wages said to be giren to agricultural labourers
in Gaudeloupe, by one of the most intelligent writers
of the party whom AsToLus represents, du not appear
to have been well founded ; and having shewn that the
real state of Gaudeloupe, during that period, proved
that agricultural labour, though constrained by severe
laws, was very little attended to, and also that the
stimulus, expected front wages, were not realised in
that Colony ; I am justified in claiming the attention of
the public to these indisputable facts, as contrasted
with the theories and speculations of AtioLus, and the
ultra Abolitionists.

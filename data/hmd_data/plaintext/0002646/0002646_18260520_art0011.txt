beyond the precise ittniu of the question. I hope, however, that
have not failed to allele, that however the dictates of humanity, VI-
I principles of the Christian Religion, and the spirit of the British
Constitution may repudiate slavery, and bold it in the detestation it
merits; there is nothing in that fact to call upon us to abolish at
' once the system, at the risk of endangering the safety of those con-
cerned, or doing wrong to those whose interests are involved.—
I hope that I have also strewn that Government is sincere in its
endeavour to carry into effect the wishes of Parliament; and that
it is only because we do not like anything which has the appearance
of menace that we do not repeat our determination that if, contrary
to our hope, we should be met by the Colonies with contumacious
opposition, we shall come to Parliament for aid to effect those
changes which are not dissonant from the spirit of the British Cou-
stitution, and which Parliament will be justified in granting the
power to carry into execution, as the production of a wholesome and
holy determination on its part—; Loud cheers.)
Mr. BROUGH ANI then rose to reply amidst loud cries of
Question!" lie said the House might adjourn the debate if
they pleated, but he would not give up his right of reply.
Sir T. ACIA ND opposed the Resolutions. Ile would rather
the question were left wholly in the hands of Government. He
thereto' e moved the previous question.
Mr. BROUG HA ‘I then replied. He maintained that slavery
had existed, not in accordance with the principles of the British
Constitution, but in spite of them. So it was with respect to
the Christian Religion. _ Could any man deny that it was most
. .

unchristian to hold a fellow being in slavcry—to treat him as
a brute beast, and at the instigations of capacious cruelty or
sordid avarice, to tear the very flesh from his bones ?—( Loud
cheers.) Such a system was essentially repugnant to Chris-
tianity, anti could by no process of sophistry be reconciled
with its mild and benignant spirit. The Right Honourable
Gentleman (Mr. Canning) had represeno-d the Resolutions as im-
posing the obligation on the I louse to proceed absolutely next Ses-
sion with coercive measures against the Colonies. The Resolutions,
however, only bound the house to take the question:again into con-
sideration next Session, if nothing should have occurred inters:rm.'
diately to obviate the necessity. As to the argument, that harass
would result from the rejection of the Resolutions, let the responsi-
bility rest on the heads of those who voted against them.
Strangers were theta ordered to withdraw, and the House divided.
The numbers were—For the Resolutions, 3s--Against them, 100.1
Majority, U.
The other Orders of the Day were then disposed of, and the
House adjourned at Foua o'Clascx this morning till Friday next.

New York and Philadelphia Papers to the 21st of
April have teethed us. The adjournment of the session
of Congress had been fixed for the 17th instant. A
I nessage from the PRESIDENT was transmitted to the
)use of Itepre enruives on the 15th of April, with
copies of a correspondence, already made public, be-
tween the Colombian and Brazilian Ministers residing
in London, to show that the Emperor of BRAZIL had
consented to send a representative to the Congress of
Panama. It also stated that Englani and France,
though with no object of joining in the deliberations,
were expected to send Agents there.
The American Consul, frail Buenos Ayres, arrived
at Montevideo on the 19th February, with a flag of
truce. His object was to see the Commander of the
Blockading Squadron. Although he had been mixing
four days, he had not been able to fall in with him.
An action took place on the 9th February, between
the Brazi,lian blockading force and the Buenos Ayres
squadron, which went forth to attack them, but pro-
duced no very striking effects, the Brazilians being dis-
posed to run away, and the Buenos Ayreans not in-
clined to follow., Admiral BROWN, who commanded
the latter, bitterly complains of all the vessels but his
owe, and itis said that if they had assisted him he would
certainly have gainei a complete victory.

A French Captain of the Fame brig of war had brought Infor-
tnation that the Brazilians had lost forty-ilve men in killed, besides
wounded. in the action, and that the Captain of the Brazilian ship
Twenty ninth of August ball been killed.

The French Papers of Wednesday and Thursday have
reached tv. They contain details respecting Mi►solon-
ghi ; but, excepting the fact of its having fallen, nothing
has yet transpired en which much reliance can be placed.
One of the French Journals states that everything in-
dicates th.t hostilities are on the point of commencing
between Russia and the Porte, and even fixes the day
when it is supposed the Russian troops will occupy the
principalities of Wallachia and Meld.via. It is said,
that the first verbal answer of the R is Effendi to the
Russian Ultimatum, expressed satisfact on that the Em-
peror NICHOLAS did not confound the question of the,

The Itises had bound with the wreath of the grove,
And the flowers of the garden, the freedom of Love,
And gave him to Venus, who sought from that hour
To release the fair youth from the bonds of their power !
That liberty gained, yet a slave hell remain,
lor die smiles 6f the fair soften slavery's chain;

THE THEATRES.

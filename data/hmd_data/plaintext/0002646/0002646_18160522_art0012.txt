A letter from Dundee says-4. The depressed state
of this town is such, that several families are literally
starving for want of employment. As an instance,
we may state the fact of a labourirg man having ap-
plied for work at the new Harbour constructing here,
and being unable to get emp:,:yment; owing to there
being 12(X) applicants bt Bare I. im."

while work/nen were engagtitt in reenr-ving the seating
and galleries, preparatory to re-modelling the interer
of the church, a large berm fell on one jf the men,
and brdised him so much, that he cUed soon after.
Dnu ay- La THEATRU.—A MUSiCaI A fterpiece.
entitled Oho on': Oath, was produced last night. The
scene is near Bagdad, where the hero of the piece, re-
presented by Mr. I'. COOKS, wins the affections of the
Caliph's daughter, Miss NAsH. By the supernatural
'ygency of a female deity they escape from the fury of
the Caliph, but the hero is shipwrecked in the territory
of the. Grand Sultan; where he is, with his servant,
consigned to slavery. Here Zoradina, the favourite
SUltana (Mrs. URGER), meets him in the garden of
the Palace, and makes love to him ; but her passion
being slighted, she attempts to stab him in revenge,
when the Sultan and his guards break in and arrest
her arm. He is then ordered with his mistress, the
Caliph's daughter, for execution, when the lovers are
again extricated by the same supernatural agency,
and the Piece concludes. The music is rich, spi- '
rited, and pleasing, and reflects high credit on its
composer, Mr. PARRY. Miss NAbli had several
airs, which she executed with great taste and delicacy.
Her last song possessed peculiar sweetness. The
dresses and decorations arc peculiarly splendid, and
die scenery rich, beautiful, and equally diversified.
—With all these advantages, however, we are sorry
to add, that a violent, and, as it appears to us, a
molt unprovoked and offensive. effort was made by
some party, whose members were scattered through
the house, to damn the Piece, without the least
gard to its actual merits 'or to its capabilities of icn-
prtmement. These persons succeeded in forcing Mr.
RAE to address the audience on the dropping of the
curtain ; when be begged of the public, in the name
of their characteristic indulgence, to suffer a second
trial for this evening, and his request was WilliagPY
acceded to by a large majority.
Wznunasrea, MAY 18.—Yesterday afternoon, be-
tween three and four o'clock, a most tremendous
thunder-storm was experienced here. For some hours
previous, indications of its approach were visible—
the atmosphere was clovN and black clouds, heavily
charged, were seen hovering over. At length the
tempest burst with awful fury—peals of thunder un.
'usually accompanied by vivid flashes of lig!it-
ning, followed in quick succession. The hail and
rain fell in such •torrents as to speedily inundate the
lower parts of several houses in and near this city.--
A stack of chimnies in College-street was thrown
down, and several windows broken. A large frag-
ment of the chimney.pot was hurled a considerable
distance by the violence of the tempest—indeed. so
awfully powerful was the concussion, that whole
buildings felt its effects.

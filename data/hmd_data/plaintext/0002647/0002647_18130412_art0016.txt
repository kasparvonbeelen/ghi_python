66 SiXOIIS ! Ye are a polite, enlighteoed people!—
. Yeti know, that
.without independence, all tile good
thiegs of this life are to noble minds of little value—
that subjection is thegiratest disgrace. You neither
can nor will bear slavery any longer. You will no
longer permit a cunning and deceitful system of policy
to carry its ambitious and depraved views into effect,
demand the blood of your sons, dry up the spring or
your commerce, depress your industry, destroy the
liberty of your press, and turn your once happy
country into the theatre of war. Already has the
Vandalism of your oppressive foreigners, wantonly
and unmercifully destroyed your most beautiful mo-
nument of architecture, the bridge of Dresden.-4
Rise! Join es! Raise the standard of insurrection
against foreign oppressors, and be free!
" Your Sovereign kin the power of foreigners, de.
deprived of the freedom of determination, dep
ploriug the steps a treacherous policy forced
him to take, we will no more attribute then
to him, than cause you to suffer for them.—
We only take the provinces of your country under
our care for yoiit,l.ord, which fortune, the supe-
riority of our arms, and the valour of our troops,
may place in our power. Supply the reasonable
wants of our warriors ; in return expect from us the
strictest discipline. Every application ,to me, the
Prussian General, shall be open to all oppressed per-
sons. I will hear every complaint, examine every
charge, and severely punish every violation of disci...
plum. Every one, even the very meanest may, with'
confidence, approach me. I will receive him with
kindness.
" The friend of German Independence will, by
us, be considered as our brother; the weak mintlod
wanderer Wf will lead with tenderness into the right
road—but the dishonourable, despicable tool of,
foreign tyranny, I will pursue with the utmost
rigour as an enemy to our common country. •

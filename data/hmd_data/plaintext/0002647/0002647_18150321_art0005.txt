,AFFAIRS-OF EUROPE. ,
Mr. itviarrottEAD rose, and, spoke nearly as
Sirtitbe Noble Lord who now is more
particularly the .object of universal attention, has
run for the last fifteen months, a great and brilliant
career. He has been selected by his Prince to re-
present this country among the assembled Powers
of Europe, to assert her rights, and to contend for
her interests, if necessary ; and as he had been se-
lected by the approbation of his friends, to fulfil
that arduous task, there were none found among
bill political opponents to question tha prepriety et
his appointment. But however Alistinguish4, enty
have been that elevated station—howevety dig-
nified the character which he may have supported,
to my mind the. Noble Lord could never have ap-
peared in a more dignified situation, that) wtpe, es A
Commoner of England, he enters thin Pmsts, to
make a statement of hiskindiviildal.coadoet, to lay
before us the proceeding of that. Council, at which
he assisted,and to disperse. those! talumnies

be asserts to have been. uttered -tipsiest himself and.
the Congress at Vienna—the. time •iik pt length ar.
riv,ed,.,when he is afforded an oppootesity of re.
pelting them, and of obtaining from the [Luse. 4
Commbns the same undivided approbation whiekr;

not strange, that if it was necessary for

the great object of his mission, without being able
to give any satisfactory, iptelligence respqting its

Tite Noble Lerd .was, it may be laid, in the bosom
of his family. Many persons nearly allied to him,
and by no means deficient in rank or intellect, were
residing with him • and is it not a slur.upon those
persons to call in the Duke of Wellington to achieve
those diplomatic labours in which they, bad pre.
viously been engaged? His Grace had been ori.

Lord would have entered this House. with the se-
veral acts of the Sovereign Princes in his hand,
making a ready and voluntary communication to
Parliament--but now it is necessary to• call on him.
for the fulfilment of his duty. it is neces-
sary, too, that, I should inform hinso•of the repeat-
ed attacks made on his colleagues during his
absence, and their constant evasions ; and that
amidst their subterfuges, one argument was fre-
quently reiterated, that the charges shade by this
side of the House were personal against' the Noble
PIA, and should not be urged in, his absence.
But Ldeny that they were personal,the charges, were;
directed not against .an individual, but,agaiust the
Government—and I shall now repeat them. The

Mr. DICKENSON rrrsented a Petition from the

Bill in progress fur altering the Poor Lasys.—Ordered
to be printed.
Mr. WARLIE moved that certain papers laid be-
f:tre the House yesterday. respecting the Extra Post

Mr. WARRE then gave notice, that on Tuesday
next he should bring forward a motion on that subject.
A MEMBER presented a Pt titiots from the Coroners
of the County of Armagh, against the Trial► Coroners:
Regulation 11111.
Mr. C. HUTCIIINSOS trusted his lion. niers.'

Mr. MARTIN (of Galway) said, he hail brought
its the Bill at the desire of the County of Galway. Ile

the Bill was unnecessary. It was the law of Estglitol
that tits civil process shoultllseexernted bt,• the Coroner
except process against the Sheriff. The present 11111
was merely to assimilate the Irish to the English law.
The Coroners of Ireland were in general insolvent, an•l
every County was liable to answer for the itefattlt of its
Coroner. As far as regarded himself, be hatl no ob•
ieetion to postpone the Bill, hut he could not ausster

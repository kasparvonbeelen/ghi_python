After the expel/lion of the French armies, the con-
querors blisiesi themselves in framing a farm of go-
vernment and establishing the liberty and independ-
ence of the people. We could nut reasonably hope
to find great knowledge and superlative principles of
legislation among men who had etswrgesl from the
yoke of slavery and ignorance, among men 1111.9 had
yet au ulcerated heart, and a mind diseased by misfor-
tunes, and who had so long tnaintained an oh.tinate
awl barbarous war, who bad alwa)s lived amid•? dan
gers, iniroods and the dust of camps. Hence, in the
Arts and measures of those times entlinsiasto i. pre-

On the that st••ps of our lerislatiye raret-r depended
the happiness or th • misery of our country ; and we
then committed a capital fault, from which perhaps
have fol'owed all our future civil wars. It n•as, not

having erected a good constitution. We hail not then
arquire4l the experience and prudence which we now
eoioy ; our ideas were not lived on the mechanises of
representative and monarchical government, and our
legislators could handle the sour I better tha•i the

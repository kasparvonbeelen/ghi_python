Before CHIEF esao,, RICHARDS. Rad a Special Jury.
THE KING r. J. H. ORANDIS.
Mr. itaaor.a opened the pleadings. This was se
d ictuirnt charging the defendants with unlawfully
.riting and publishing a certain scandalous sad sedi-
tious libel of and concerning the government of Nis
and the employment of the King's troops,
and of ansi concerning his Royal Highness the Regent,
the 20th day of December last, in the parish of
irmingbam.
Mr. CLARKE stated the case.—He expatiated, at
•onsideruhle length, on various extracts from the
ibel (which svere afterwards read in evidence), sad
described the whole matter of the publication to be,
the highest degree, libellous and seditious. lie ri-
diculed, in very pointed terms, the folly und presump-
tion of persons, in the low and obscure sphere of the
defendant. setting themselves np as the censors of
Ivernment, the reformers of our venerable Consti-
.ion, and the advisers of their Prince. When he had
?roved the publieatiun, he had no doubt that the Jury
mould find such s verdict as would satisfy the justice
the case—a verdict of Guilty—against the de-
fundant.

The libel, which was entitled " An Address to the.
lioforniers of Birmingham and its neighbourhood,"
gas then put in.
The CHIEF-Hams inquired, whether the defendant
lilted the whole of the publication to he read ?
The defendant answered in the negative.
The Clerk then read the following extracts :
" Fellow Couutrynteu,—A crisis is fast approach-
lg. which, to use the memorable expression of the cele-
trrted Paine, will try men's souls : it is ts crisis
herein the patriotism of all will be put to the severest

greatest importance, not only to this, hot to every
,ucceeding generation ; for upon the issue depends
Phether Englishmen are to enjoy the blessings of
iherty. anti their country be great and free, which
iron, the excellency of its climate, its soil and re-
sources, they had a right to expect ; or whether they
ail aubuiit to a military despotism, accompanied

We have already experienced, in the murder Of
tr countrymen 'at Manchester, and the shameful
of justice N the injured, what we have to es-
poct from the clemeucy of our rulers, when their will
v4;,ersedes that of the law. That never-to-be-forgotten

ceed in their nefarious warfare against our rights :
I say, should they succeed In this hitt crusade

I:mhargic s;ernber, and make every exertion that is
to thwart she ansehleations of your gyre's-
Aura ; trust to some but yourselves ; leer fitteendra•

them to that contempt they merit. Every effort, both

trite to get up what they call a loyal, but what I
,houid designate a lying declaration, as it is well
mown that numbers of individuals have been threat-

person to decide who are the greatest traitors to

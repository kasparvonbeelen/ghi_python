equal to our **lions' bits prosieritymed freedom. •
though I may be thought vain in attempting to con-
trovert the sentiments of learned meu,whlch have been
se long and generally established, yet I am per-
suaded we have been for centuries under a dreadful
delusion. I am, indeed, sensible these are greater
blessings and enjoyments in this kingdom than in
r any other, but there is also the greatest oppression,
misery, and injustice. As distress is not so public
and visible here as in other countries, foreigners do
not suppose it exists, and we also by that means ale
in a great measure ignorant of it. Fur our unfor-
tunate countrymen are either confined in jails of dif-
ferent
descriptions, or else through false shame
• -
they confine themselves in their garrets and ob4core
abodes by day if not by night ; knowing thstporerty
is punished as a crime, and that the poor aye held in
such contempt as if it was a less sin to let one of
them starve than a dog or s cat. Our imaginary
greatness and literary knowledge produce that na-
tional pride which makes us blind as well as arbitrary;
and prevents our attaining the real pre-emihence we
might other w iseacquire. We have the title of the Proud
Islanders, and seem pleased with the epithet,
though I never understood that pride was a sign of
- -.mine

vent their it , it. either by persoo ,a rime.—
abuse of wealth, or arbitrary power. For any sine
of these evils may so increase, as to destroy that
social freedom for vrhich they surrender their natural
liberty; and accordieg as they small three restrained
it will be enjoyed. lience, though the-Government
should be good in form and principles, yet if it tole-
rates personal revenge, there may be aR winch fight-
ing and discord in the kingdom as there is among
savages in a state of nature; while the numbers who'
assemble as spectators acquires quarrelsome temper
and unfeeling disposition,•which reader them unfit
r society, and instrumental to the coiruptiun of
ethers. Yet, instead of there being any effectual)
regulations in this respect; revenge seems to be con-:
,1,1)
sidered as a virtue, and is celled it 'noble spirit.
'Hence, fighting is encOursgerl from infancy to old
'age, and even the fair sex are sn affected by it, as to
give a preference to the most unchristian spirit. If
then the State should become so corrupt as to re•
quire a national effort to reform it, what songui-
nary contests might we not expect among a People
of opposite interests antiltentiments, who wish so re-
semble a lion rather than a lamb. Yet Gnvernntent
oterlooks the licentious conduct of duelling and
boring, which cherishes a vindictive and turbulent
spirit, and punishes licentious words lest they should
produce a turbulent cuothict. Is not this se) jog, in
other words, mat " the People may insolt each. other,
and fight as tong as they like, provided they do nut
insult or frighten them?" which is exactly like the
Pandemonium of Sidon, which requires the most
loyal t•uhjeoion to him and his government, but
allows his subjects to have as mach discord and vio-
lence among themselves as they please.
Again, if laws are not enacted to prevent the abuse
, of wealth, the middling and lower orders of the Peo-
ple may be imperceptibly reduced by it to a state of
the most servile dependence and misery. For if all the
land capable of cultivation is monopolised by a small
stember of the inhabitant's, who till it themselves, or
let it at very high resits; and if, to gratify their pride,
indolent e, and pleasure, as well as for other uses„
such a number of horses are kept as require almost
the whole produce of the soil for their subsistence ;
and if this demand is made by those who have money
to pay any price for it (which the, People cannot fur
their food), then it is evidently the interest of the
farmer to cultivate the land, chiefly for those ani-
mals ; which keeps tip the price of all kinds of provi-
sions by lessening their quantity, and thus man is
served after the brute with his morsel of daily
bread. The rain may fell to fertilize the grgend
the sun may shine to ripen the corn, and. Gon he will-
ing to send ahundaece for every creature to be fed.
that " there may be tin complaining in our streets ;"
yet the People may becleprived of the bounty of Pr 0.7.„
vidence by an abuse, of wealth.

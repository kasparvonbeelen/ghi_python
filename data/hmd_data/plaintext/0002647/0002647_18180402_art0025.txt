kctioseqeence to me who setilhe Representatives of
Ithis town, I hctoe no viol end why should I trooble
rtnyeelf about the affairs of thew ate." •
This conversation (however trifling it may be
*wed) manifestly shows the indifference which some
:people have in the politics of the country : indeed I
cannot see how they should act otherwise; the reply
of this man was certainly a very just one. While
the People are excluded from voting (as our Reptile
sentatives are elected by so role!' a portion of the
People), I see no grounds for hoping or thinking that
men will trouble themselves about the political state
of the cowry. ;-;y•. yo,,
A Reform is the House of Commons spost be first
obtained before any good can be expected horn the
present system of Representation, whether to alle-
viate the pressure of the Tales or to promote the
happiness of the People. The grand system of Reform
.which I conceive ought to rouse every Englishman,
is a fair Representation in the People; what I
mean by a fair Representation is, that every House-
keeper paying 51. a year King's Taxes, sboeld have
a vote; this I conceive to be the easiest and simplest
plan that could be adopted to purge the present in-
fluence which rich men have over other classes of the
community ; and if every Housekeeper had a vote,
the whole system of bribery and corruption would
fall to the ground ; every man then would have an
interest in the welfare and happiness of the country ;
the attachment of the People to the Constitution
wpold be apparent, by the interest which an election
would excite; and a rich man, with all his Ministe-
rial influence, would find the torrent of public opi-
nion so poweiful against him, that were he pos-
sessed of all the gold mines of Peru, it would pre-
pondei are very little in his favour ; reason would no
longer be stifled ; liherty would again unfurl her
banners, and corruption and tyranny would sink
into nougat. This would he the spirit of Englishmen.
Au opportunity is fast approaching when the Peo-
ple will possess this glorious privilege; when
every Freeholder awl Liverymaii will have a fair op.
portunity of making choice of men who can be re-
lied on ; man who will curt their talents for the
great cause of Reform ; men who are attached to.the 1
Constitution of the country, and of well-known in-
tegrity.
I now, Sir, take my leave, once more calling anon
Englishmen who love their country, to be aria frivolous.
Unanimity will defeat a host of foes. If we ago at-
tached to our country, if KO respect its Consti-
tetion, if we are Minus in our desire for retlia-
*outer, Ro(ttrin, the lime, the day is fast approach-
isig• Let ili aeize the opportunity. I call spot) every
.town in Englasid, and particularly the City of Lon-
don, to stand forward and show a gond example to
the country. If the foul actions of the presentbli-
'dairy and their adherents are not sufficient to awake
the Nation to a proper senile of feeling, lot o.4gido
sink into slavery, and no more be called Engliabestop.

DRURT•LANE THEATRE.— A new farce, calls :41a
Sleep:mg Draught, was performed last night at this
Theaue for the first time, end with success. The
dialogue seld,an rises above mediocrity, and rarely
indeed into wit or humour, has nothing in it parti-
cularly to deserve censure, or calculated to give of-
fence. The chief merit is in the plot and incidents,
which, though somewhat improbable, are whimsical
wets-conttived,and kept the audience is (minter-
espied good humour. II•oLzy is the life of the
piece. The character he performs is that of a sir.
sant, the chief agent in a love intrigue ; in the
course of hi; enterprise, which takes place at the
house of a medical practitioner, he *wallows a liquid
left on a table, which proves to he a sleeping
draught, and being supposed dead, is pat into a
chest ; he afterwards undergoes a variety of perils
and adventures, and becomes in the end) by accident,
the means of uniting the two lovers in whose tervical
he was engaged. The scene where he takes the po-
tion and believes himself poisoned, and tbet of, his
recovery, when, from some ipeechei be onetime
and misinterprets, he thinks be is about to be killed,
were manage( with great skill. KNIGUT has nisi the
'part of a servant in it ; the rest of the farce was
somewhat undercast in point of talent. The scene is
placed in Italy ; but there is uo reference either to
Italian manners or character.
It is reported in the City, that • Consolidation of
the Duties on Russian produce is in coutemplation ;
in consequence of which) some articles will remain
nearly as at present, but one or two others will be
subjected to a much heavier impost.
Ma. KEAN —As • report has in some degree pro-.
railed, that Mr. Rams, the celebrated performer, lm
performing the part of Sir Giles Overreach, at Gies-,
gow, on Thursday evening, had broken a blood-
line by over-efertion, and died on that evening;
if think it necessary for the satisfaction of the
Plblic, to insert the following paragraph from the
Glasgow Chronicle of Saturday ; from which it
mil appear, that, instead of having died on
thrust] Ay, Mr. KEAN, according to the old
phrase, was alive and merry on Friday
ad After performing Ilerlraus with his usual es-
adlence last night, Mr. KEAN visited the popular
todge of St. Mark's, of which he is a Member, end
spent the evening in the most convivial manner. On
his health being drank, be returned thanks for the
honour done him, and said, that the kindness and
r.partiality shown bins by the inhabitants of Glasgow
had made on him the deepest impression; so mach
so, 'that, without borrowing from the great Prot

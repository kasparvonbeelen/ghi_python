believe a more bold and open contempt

the instance of Mr. Yorke's enforcing the

;1 slwll-sot call them stratigety) from tho HouseOf
,:„nitions ; and this, too, dote at a time whoa a
m of that House had considered it absolutely
n for allaying the indignation of an in-
salted p.felek, that thu " Inquiry" (now going
, ~) should be done in the most comprehensive and
~btiewarseer " that era Committee of the whole
11:iuse."
It is not my intention to complain of the " ee-
rie-ion frain the House" on the present °ma-
,;.o only, but to protest itgainst the 46 Order"
bpou ell uccutions. Is it not astonishing to see a
Iv:dation s hich was made to prevent tae inter-
prow of a despotic King and Government, now
turned i!ito a practice to cover and secrete the nefe.
tious acts of a disgraced Ministry ? Do we live
under a despotic King, who would dare to lend
big pries to mark the man who did his duty in the
'loose of Commons? On the contrary, are we
nut Messed with a King who respects, above all
thiligr, the liberty of his subjects p Why then
shiail the House of Commons (which ought to
t, the lalladitiin of one rights) turn upon usli-
and, 1, y chatting the Gallery, exclude the people
fr,,a aie:u ofa their Representative:.
it is not now necessary to argue in defence of

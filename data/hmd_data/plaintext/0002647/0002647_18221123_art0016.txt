This was a snit of divotse I ntessiel et there, promoted
by Mr. Tharlow, the hust";nd;againit his wife Nude ,
Marlow, by reason of adultery. The !deeding. were
teed at great length by Dr..l .. . pod Dr. Lusa:no-
ses, immediately atter which the Court proceeded to
t.
The Learned Jonas (Sir Christopher Robinson) ele
&erred, that the p cause originated in a suit,
brought by the defendant, for a restitution of conju-
kil rights. She bad not succeeded in establishing a
'claim to the interference of the Court on her behalf;
and it would appear by the evidence which had been
that day produced, that at the time when she institote'd
she proceodingjest mentioned 'bewail living in adultery,
and passing as the wife of a person with whom she ear.
ried.on the criminal intercourse. In what spirit, or for
what purpose the suit was commenced under such cir-
cumstances, it was difficult to imagine, though the Court
was willing to admit the most favourable interpretation
it world bear. The parties to the snit then pending
were, it seemed, married about thirteta yeiro before,
and the answer of the husband went back to there,
1809. For a considerable period they lived traplailly
together, and bad five children before their separatioa.
t was not till 1821 that Mr. Thurlow became fully ap-
prised of his wife's infidelity, or discovered the idol-
'irons connection which had subsisted between kw and
several individuals. in answer to thew, charges Mrs.
Thurlow had resorted to recrimination,,and it ars' some.

must provoking diffi-
culty in which he found!hiotself entangled.
Mr. Stedman being desired to proceed, said towards the
close of lar.t month his wife, during his absence in the coun-
try, let the first floor of his house to two gentlemen at a
rent of 211. per annum. He did not see them, but from
their appearance, be, from subsequent events, knew them to
be the persons charged with the murder of Mr. Weare, and
they having brought into his boasts a certain quantity of
goods, took possession of the apartments, as they said, for
a gentleman named Brown. On hearing of the murder, Ise'
judged it orndegfto 'give some information relative to the'
propertirin hieMe• the police, and the inquiry that
took place was already before the public. to consequence
of that in airy, a claim by the officers of the Commis•
sioners of bankrupt, appointed in Thomas Thartell's ease,
was made on this property, and an attempt was made to
gain possession, but being advised, he refused admission to
the officers of the Commission fur some time, bat they, by
a strataffem practised about eleven o'clo..k 04 Tuesday
night, got a man into the house whom he had locked in,
being determined not to allow any thing to be remelted, and
now was on the one band threatened with the Visitation of
the Lord Chancellor's order, on the other with an action
for fa'sely imprisoning the man, and hourly lispected an
order from John Thurtell or Hunt calling as higa to give
up the property. In this most awkward dill is he re•
quested the Magistrate's interference.
Mr. Oaten-m-1 really think you are placed in a curi-
ous predicament. How is it that the Bankrupt Commis-
sioners put in a claim, when you state the property to be
that of the man charged with Murder ? '
Mr. Stedman-1 have ascertained that they, od the pub•
lication of the inquiry before anotheiMagistrate, took up
some clue which had been almost broken, and aunt* my
house, stating that they had evidence to prove the property
was removed from place to place by the bankrupt Thomas
Thortell, and was finally removed by his brother John to
my house. I would not willingly resist their order, bat I
d net know how to ac .
Mr. tit:milli—Thera have been two applications made
to me by the messenger of the commission, but as I know
nothing but the mere floating rumour attending the
murder, and the daily accounts in the newspapers; I would
not interfere, and certainly I think 1 cannot interfere even
on this application.
Mr. Stedman —I, would give up the property if they can
prove it to be the bankrupt's ; but boa, can I do so without
an indemnity; hereafter the Crown en iy call on me to
render up the property of John Thurtell, attainted with
murder.
Mr. UntrriTH—l am well aware, from being conversant
in the laws of this case, that you Can be compelled by the
Commissioners to give op all property sworn to as belong•
ing to the bankrupt; and you are liable to be cited before

obscene language, enticing passengers to go in, some
of whom sometimes were persuaded to enter tine
bpese. The girls frequently went home late at nigh(
taking with them • men in a state of stupid intolica4
tion ; and their indecencies were se conspituous as
to be intolerably offeusive to the family who Ike!
opposite, aml,had induced two lodgers to leave the
house adjoiebeg. On the 22d of July, there was a
riot before fhb 'house,. and in it a man appeared at
the wiudo* milling for a ladder to escape ; his
cries brought 0. gentleman to the house, who insister(
on his libeyation, upon which he • ran out and

could esercise no contralti, a whom it was impel,.
;Obits to turn out without proper notice. No con•
nection Mu proved between the landlord and the
lodgers, no'connivance, no encouragement, no par'.
cipation in their shameful gains. The moment he
was able; the landlord had dismissed than, and had
sincotaken a very quiet and respectable tenant. It
I was then' sworn. by some witnesses, lodgers in the
botne„ that there ha& never been a riot except on
the bee night, tine 22d of July : there was some
dancing now and then, and a dram : they had never
seen ally indeitencies : the women complained of had
left the lodgings last September, and since that time
a decent couple had possescion of them.
Mr. MAiNwAttixo thought the case had not been
proved: the lodgers, no doubt, were of as infamous
dkcription ; but it did not appear that there RAS
any connection between, them and the D•fe,ldmits.
The Jury immediately acquitted the D.heltlanti4
when Mr. MAINWARING cautioned them r 4 in their
future tenants ; and.seld, it would go hard A MI them
if they should-again he found to admit such lodgers.
They were then discharged.

to impress every candid and rational ailed With this
great truth, that to tax industry is contrary to the
laws allid customs of oar ancestors—contrary to the
•dictetee of justice, and contrary to sound policy.—
, In skort, such a practice is neither constitutional,
just, nor wise, bat on the cootraty most- illegal, ty ran-
;licit, and improvident. Any plan of reform, there-
fore, that has a tendency to legitimate such a prac-
tice, will not improve but deteriorate the condition of
these pitpr people, and the projector thereof will not
&eleve their blessiegs, but their Maledictions.
With respect to Universal Suffrage and General
Suffrage, it is, I conceive, a distinction without a dif-
ierenee. In my mind the resemblance is so near, that
Put them in al has and'shalee 'ern,
' The devil himself might well militate 'em ;
that is, he might well be in doubt which of the two
wis hell cilcolaftd for his purposes of mischief. It
is on the ground of 'taxation 'that many uphold this
estravagaot extension of the Right of Suffrage, and
it is east ly on that ground that I oppugn it. They
weg that what concerns ell should he debated end de-
cided by all—Qisod tangit om net tractetur ab
omni-
bus. This, no doubt, is sound constitutional doc-
trine ; but then I contend that taxes ought not to be
applied to all, and that such a measure is not only
Indust, bat impolitic.
The principle on 'bleb our ancestors acted re-
specting tuition,' was this :—Evers man who wale
' liable to be 000.0, said they,. Meg 'lt to be repownted,
berme no man's money ought to he taken fran him
his consent ; bit he • who was not liable to
be lased, tie who bed no propert) to which legation
could attach, had no need of a Representative; its'
so •rt, they considered it as an encroachment on the
rights of others, that a verson, having no property of
his own, and therefore not ohnosious to taxitinn,
should send a Representative to Parliament for taxing
the property of others.
Another principle with Stir ancestors was, that
Issies ought to beleid on superfluities, and never up-
on the necessaries of life. He whose industry was
only able to furnish him with a comfortable subsist-
ence was esempt from the subsidiurn or .aid ; it was
only whets he had stored up wealth, and became the
possessor of superfluities of a certain annual value,
that be became obnoxiouto to taxation. No man who
did not prey scot and lot had his name put upon the
list of persons liable to the subsidium, a criterion
that still may be said• to exist; for if a man fails in
paying his taxes, he loses his right of Suffrage. In.
short, the aid was a per tentage on property, and he
oh• had none, or whose real or personal property

or to pay him so much money hi coMeetisatiora
thereof, and whose person is the property of the
owner of the estate, and sold with it. Such a 'cote.
rarisen, I contend, must naturally have arisen
the mind of every freeman who found himself rob-
bed of the produce of his own industry by means of
a Capitation Tax ; and to this circumstance, no doubt,
we are to attribute the general resistance which those
taxes produced. The Kings of England at that day
had large possessions upon the Continent, where this
tax was common, but they never could succeed is
their attempts to establish it in England, bectese
the spirit of liberty which prevailed here never per.
mitted any of those projects of slavery and oppres.
sion, transplanted frees the Continent, to bad rent.
Now, however, tlie thing is dent, though in an un-
derhand antillidlrect way ;,no Poll Tax Is demanded
of the poor British labourer, but that's are laid uptick
those accessories of life which he must consume or
perish, so as tri take .away Rpm his earnings 10s.
out of every eighteen, according to Mr. PRESTOrr'O
calculation.. Is not such a man the Helot, the Serf,
the Homo Proprietatis of all those fu: whom he la-
bours—that is to say, of the Sinecure Pocemen, the
Pensioners, and others, receiving money from the
public purse, for which they have rendered to the
State no equivalent service.

At Eaton Hall, the seat of Karl Grosvenor, devasta-
tions Caused by the late storm flare been very serious.
Some of the pinnacles hive been blown from the battle-
ments of the Hall, and ethers are materially injured.
Many fine trees •were blown down, in particular the
beautiful tall fir, so generally admired, and the old go.
thin oak, near the green-hosse. The damage done in
the grounds is very great, independent of the loss of
glass, &c. in the Hall and out-houses. A sheep was
killed in the Park ; between Eceleston Hill and the
Hall nearly forty. large trees were torn up ; between
twenty and thirty in the garden wood, and about twenty
in the Folioed avenue. The garden presents a scene of
mach devastation.
The steeple of Wylantihory Church, so long remark-
able for its inclination to one side. as to be called by
some the hanging
.steeple, is completely blown over.
A beantiful variegated partridge was shot by John
Coates, Esq. of Woodeute, Shropshire, the latter end of
October. A fine silver white WAS the predominant co-
lour, harmoniously mixed with greys and reddish
browns; the bill was nearly white, . except the front,
which was grey.
An udertunete and alarming cireumstance occurred on
Tuesday evening last. In the parish of Castle Comb, Witt-
shire. A quantity of beef soup was prepared, and distri-
buted to the numerous poor families .of the parish, which
was boiled in a large copper furnace ; and, either from the
poisonous listere of the copper, or its not being properly
cleaned, all who partook all were, about ushlniaht, so-
land), attacked in the stomach and bowels. Nearly the
whole parish were complaining—children crying, and the
people running baked into the streets and gardens ; which
crested confusion more easily Imagined than described.
Many of the labourers could not work the next day; but,
fortunately, no inatanee of ISTS:S illegal- followed.—(Both

9 the machinery-was in motion to drive a thrashing milt

A large shiwi, which the girl had wrapped round her-
! sell and child. got entangled wit!' the shaft, and begrea
to carry them both round. The girl, with considerable
presence of mind, endeavonred to extricate herself and
the child, and succeeded in getting heeself free from the
shawl, but by this time her petticoats grit wrspt round
the lower part of the shaft, and she was thrown down
and carried in revolution with it. There heing bat len.
inches of free space on each side of the shaft, and be-
tween the bowing Or two pair of mill stones, there was
not room fur her body to pass through in a lying pm-
Jere, and both bur thighs were broken, one of them in

,the thrashing mill, being alarmed by the girl's :ries,
came to her aid, and the machinery was stopped. The
infant was found banging by the shawl to the upper.
part of the shaft, considerably compressed, but in no
visible way injured. It was necessary to cut away the.
clothes of the poor girl before she could be removed.
and she endured the removal to her home, at a little dis-
lance, and the subsequent setting of her Hollis, with great
composure. She is in a fair way of recovery.—(Stir-

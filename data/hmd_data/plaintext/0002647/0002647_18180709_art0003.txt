A literman Good behere.--Three times three.
Mr. Alderman Gocrosentne returned thanks, and
ersneratulated them on their deliverance from the
trammels which had confined all their efforts.--.( /fp.
rtause.)—Mankind would ere now have been much
..i'vanced in science, literatere, wealth, and happi-
',egg, but for tha preposterous systems of Govern-
weevil which had prevailed, and entailed slavery, O-
s %lion, and misery upon men.—(Great amlause.)-

Mr. Alderman Titoar, in returning thanks, con-
gratulated them, 430 t so much because he happened

1'411,1, of their choice of his friend, whose long, able,
et.(l conscientious support of freedom, entitled him
r.. the warmest gratitude of his fellow-citinens ; but
I. !cause they had established their own independence,
--(Great applause )—lt would be his duty and study

i.usted that when the day of account came be should
sat he found to have been unfisithfel. His father,
his age and health had allowed him to be present,
ss field have told them what his principles bad been
1.4 50 years, and from them they might, perhaps,
it rye inferred his own.—(Great applause.)—Of his
election he bed only to say, that while Mr. Waith-,
plater was doubtful, be had no sight to require'thelr.

•11;action for his success.—(Raplorons endwise.)

Mr. 13vNa said that England, nay the world, was
i,.debted to them for the esample they had given.—
They had gives an 'sample to the powerful, that
Ilse)? were answerable for their conduct to those
Isom whom they derived all their power. (Ap-
:douse )—The change was already visible. Those
.:ho had always branded them as factious, discon-
r..eted, and daergerous, now spoke of their conduct
only constitutional oppositiuts.—(Much tanker
and applause.—Nothing, in his judgment, was so
t sctious at this moment as the Administration itself.
(Great applause.)—lle should persevere its the
course which had obtained the arilrohation of the
People. If he felt alarmed when his constituents
felt no alarm, he would resign his seat, and not at-
tempt by his puny efforts to counteract the general
%se of the People.—(Very great applause )--The
Irls Revolution was the fertile resource for every
of alarm. Nothing had occasioned the evils of
Revolution but the obstinate tyranny' of the old
'al Family of France.—(.Shouts (f applause.)—
principles of freedom alone had raised this
illy into distinction, and those principles would

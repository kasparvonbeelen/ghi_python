rCONCLU,DE6 FROM OOR PAPER 01 YESTERDAY.] 'against
• and insensibility
At.riccu ordained, by the consent of his reo.
,ple, for all his laws were- sp- made i because, as
he himself tells us, he did not dare to make
them otherwise. ,tent er; I repeat, ordained cosi,.
mini sponsione (to use BaacTori's phrase), by the
commit), will ef the people, and " by and with
the authority of the same," as out modern Acts of
Parliament -du still express it—he ordained, that no
slave should continue in bondage above six years,
.unleas it were by his own consent—in which.case, a
Illsetk was to be set upon him at the church door,
4/Alert:, before all the people, hia ear was bored, and
,Ikriog•put into it, in token that, from fidelity and
offectiou, he had freely bound himself to his master
for life. But the bondage of all other slaves tenni..
itakd upon the sixth year, and, during those six.
years, moderate correction only was allowed the
master, such, indeed, as is allowed now to the master
of an apprentice, whole term of bondage is gene.
rally seven years; so that the Saxon slaves, during
the time for which they were bound, resembled our
apprentices; and, I have some reason to think, were
much bitter off than our parish- apprentices are,
especiaibti la I* west of England, where young
girls siveso& to do the work of men in husbandry„,
which their strength is not equal to, and are, be-al
sides, treated in a way, that it would be, I am sure,
'an amelioration of their condition, if ALFRED'S
laws respecting slaves were put in force in their fa.
sour. Iti.shart, it would not, perhapi, be going too
fur, to assert, that the condition. of the labouritig
classes in England is, in wispy respects, 'eerie than
-tiny state of slavery of which the SIISDIIS had any
comprehension. Neither are we to suppose that this
slavery attached to'the Salmis themselves : no, they
,were all free men; and the very meanest of them 'had
a portion of the larid which they had conquered in
constnou. lite sire.here spoken of was his captive
—a slave attaptie for life, afterwardii for six years
only, by the laws of ALFRED. his bondage expired
he was given land foe a term et -years; and that
term expired, it was At the will of hie lord or master
to renew it ; he became first a 'Maid, and then a
copyliolder—and altheegbile had not Abe absolute
ownership of the land, pet he had the absolute free•
dom of his person, and -could. only be punished or
lined, by a Jury. of " good men and true," in' the
Manor Court. As to his doing nteeial services to
his former bard, such as ploughing his land, carting
his dung, reaping his crops, &c. that was. the con-
sequence of compact,* and considered as a portion of
his rent. .
I have been the more particular in these-details, as
I conceive them necessary teezplein wpass age in the
Author I have quoted, and which seas not unlikely
to have excited the wonder of theßeader ; I allude
to that where he asserts, that the greatest rigour
used to slaves was- only reducing thihn to the state
that farmers are in at this time. To the trothof this
-statement I perfectly agree, though I must object
to the word reduce; because the Saxon slaves were,
nut reduced,• but, On the contrary, exalted into a
condition equal to that of farmers with us. I must
beg the Roaders's excuse nevertheless for this verbal
criticism, *hid, perbapsEhe will consider as not very
becoming in a man, who is far from beingottentive
to the selection of the terms that he himself uses.' .'
I shall now proceed to the application of the ins.;
portant facts just stated; and, in so doing, Label!,
I hope,*convey some feeble conception to the ;Reader
of the immense blessings that ALFRED conferred
upon his country. The effect produced by his laws
was a gradual emancipation of more than half, per•
haps two-thirds, IA the population of,England, from
a state of absolute, unmitigated slavery. When our
ancestors lived in a state of idolatry, they conceived
that war gave them an absolute right over the per. ,
sons of the vanquished ; they could -kill them on the
instant, or preserve them for such purposes as they
chose to put them to, excepting however every tenth I
captive, whom it was required. to sacrifice to WODEN. 1
In most countries the number of slaves exceeded that.,,
of the freemen ; in Greece there was a fearful odds:
I will suppose however a half, perhaps two-thirds,
•of the population in England emancipated by
the effect of ALFRED'S laws; and taking a guess'
of the population from the powerful armies ,
then brought into the field, I cannot suppose
theta to have been less than three or four mil-
lions. I must also beg the reader to consider,
that the inestimable benefit of freedom was not i
only communicated to this large body of men, i
but also to. their descendants; how many human 1
beings then have participated is this blessing for
these nisie hundred yore past,. which have elapsed I
since his death, I leave the Reader to :conjecture ; ;
as also, how many millions may be now in existence,'
the descendants from the same stock, who are in-
debted to* Mtn for freedom; in short, which Of us
can tell, that he is not descended from -a. person
thus liberated ? Nor was the benevoleitce of this
Patriot King confined to persons lan nisbing in that

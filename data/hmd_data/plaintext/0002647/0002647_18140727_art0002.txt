Sir J. M. ACK I NTO:H presented PetitiOns against
the Slave Trade, from Dingwall in Scotland, from.
Ileulle-ors-Thames, Dreitseitclf, and Wincenton,
from Wivklow, from several other places. He
said, that in presenting these Petitious, from the
course of the Rassion nearly the list of that long train
of Petitions, which might now be safely said to
convey to Parliament and to Europe, the genuine,
spoilt:mews, and unanirunus opiiiiun of the British
naiints, he w.an desirous of saying a few words on
the present ..tate of the great. question on which that
opinion had been thus prounuirced. All .the
Peti-
tlonNrs had seen the Articie in the Treaty with re-
gret and disappoilernerit. Many, among tvitom he
must iiiinther himself, had viewed it with feelings
which veculd call f), much stronger larigoagevbut
'he was desirous to avoid the revival of ere,ry
cal discussion of the subjects He should only guard
himself, and those wish whom he agreed, from a
misconception to which they had been subject. The
question, in their view of it, during the negociation
at Paris, was not whether humanity, or even justice,
was to be imposed on France, hut whether dishonour.
was to he averted from Great Britain ? It was
whether we could be fairly required to restore our
colonial conquests, without equivaleisti, and upon
conditions, which, to be consistent with ourselves,
we must deem to brand us with the blackest disgrace?
We, were to restore colonies, all avowedly, and awns,
exclusively, to he converted into the insttementCof
what we punished in our private subjects as robbery
and murder. This was a humiliation never imposed,
in the most disastrous negociation, upon any Eu-
ropean nation. It was never proposed to drive
France into the practice of general humanity by the
force or the fear of arms, but to repel this foul dis-
honour from ourselves, at the risk of that ehternatite
of prolonged warfare, which is intoned in every seri-
.ous, at least in every earnest proposal of an article
of a 'freaty, and which one party cannot disavow,
without openly proclaiming that the opposite party
is the master of the negociation. The position of
the British negotiator at Paris respecting this Article
was purely defensive. We had only to ward oil' from
ourselves the ignominious necessity of becoming ac-
complices in a crime which our laws bad declared to
be of the deepest dye, and subjected to the highet
penalty. But that vantage ground had been lost;
awl he only adverted to it for the purpose of self
defetwe. Much ground still remained, and some had
even been gained since the last discusSion of the
subject. The unhappy failure in the Treaty had even
produced so'ne ar!rantage by calling forth a general
Aeclaratioe of national sentiment, and arming, the.
Noble Lord with a more decisive public opinion thin
ever a Negociator carried into a Congress. The
principle of our colonial lesson, was, itself a great
advantage in an equitable discussion of the subject.
He agreed with the Noble Lord that was impoa-
sihle to offer Colonies to an independent nation, as
the wire of humanity. It was as clear an insult to
bribe, as to bully a State into the observairce of
.humanity or justice. This was not the manner iu
which he considered the restitutimt of the Colonies,
as connected with the negociation for the abolition.
We had ceded these Colonies- for no equivalent.—
We could not have been dePrlted of them by the
events of war. They. were celled in obedience to
just and liberal principles, of general and colonial
policy, which he should be the foremost to applaud.
They were ceded, that France might have a portiOn
of colonial power, which the system of Europe re-
quired that she should possess: that sources of wealth

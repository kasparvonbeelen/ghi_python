PRICE SEVEN PENCE.

by what had happened at Ouirdalou; e to the an( ,rtu
nate Pelage, to the immortal Pelgresse, and to those
unfortunate imligenal inhabitant s of that isle, who
even now groan in slavery, after having enjoyed the
sweets of liberty, we might judge, if we should have
the misfortune to yield through weaknesv, what would
be the injustice, the cruel and barbarous treatment
we should have experienced.
_

The General-in-Chief, Toussaint Louverture, had
put the whole of St. Domingo under the banners o;
France, and he had expelled the great planters spa the
foreigners they had about them. The Republic wr,
triumphant. General Toussaint was incessantly c
pitied in effacing the evils of the war, re-establishing
good order, and causing agriculture to prosper. He
afforded special protection to the ex-colonists, who en-
joyed still their ci-devant property as under the an•
cleat regime, with the exception that they no longer
pousuud the power if life and des& over the black.,
nor was it lawful for them to inflict blows at their
price and pleasure.
But slavery no longer reigned, and General Toe.-
saint wu all-powerful. This order of things was m•:
agreeable in Frai:re, nor to the ex-colonists. To re-
establish slavery, they set themselves to work to weaf:•
en his power. And with this view, Gen. Heclouvi"g
was sent to Saint Domingo by the French Oovernmeo-..
with secret instructions to kindle the flame of el%
war between the blacks and the people of colour.

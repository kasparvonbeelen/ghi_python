The prisontron being asked, before Mr. Justice ffol.
royd summed up, whether lie had any witnesses to cha-
racter, said; " Yes, he had a great many, who would
give him an excellent character." When enquiry was
made whether they were present, he replied, "No, they
are not in this country." '
The jury found the prisoner Guilty. The Wife of the
Iprosecutor recommended him to mercy, us the ground
of no violence having been offered the inmates. This
the learned judge said sbouhl be attended to.

A letter from a Gentleman at St. Bartholotnews, to
bis friend in Baltimore, dated the 31)th October, observes,
" Commerce is completely tit a stand at this barren rod:,
and if it were not for the few privateers that still ern-
demos and send their prizes olf the port, URI would
not have the money to pay the current expences of the
Government; and as it is, I expect the next year they
will have to draw on the Nlother Country."

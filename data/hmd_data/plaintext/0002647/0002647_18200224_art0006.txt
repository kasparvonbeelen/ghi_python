RIF:VENCE OP THE CROWN.

Mr. lIROUMIAM hoped, that as the Papers which
he formerly moved for, relative to the Revenue• of the
Crown, could not he bronght up before the dissolution
of Parliament, a couditi I order would he ma !e, th..i
they should he printed before the meeting of the nes:
Parliament. It was of the utmost importance that these
Papers shoot!' he in the hands of the new Members, as
it would fivilitete the arrangement of the Civil List,
The CHANCELLOR of the EXt HEQUER said,
that it was impossible that the accounts in question-
mould be i 11111 l mliately produced, but before the meeting
of the nest Psrliament they would be printed.
The SPEAKER said, that such an order could not he
matte by the Ilimae. It was, however, usual to have
papers moved for at the close of a Session printed Wi
the reress, and he saw no reason why it should nut h.•
done in the present instance.
The CHA NUELLOR of the EXCHEQUER coincided
with this arrangement.

or place where negroes and people of colour arc held
in slavery. The prisons have all Leen thrown open,
and more than flair thousand oor psatils have been
liberated. It is too shucking to relate their miserable
condition ; some have had their Lacks broke kusbas-

Forty millions of dollars wert fiwnd in the citadel,
and a good deal of it is to be put in circulation. The
Queen, Prince, and Princesses, arc in town; they

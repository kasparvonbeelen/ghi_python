FromSATURDAY'S LONDON GAZETTE,Stpi. 28.

This Gazette motives the arrival ,of Rear Admiral
'Milne, with dispatches from Lord Exnioutb, the dupli-
cates of which have already appeased in this paper.
Then follows the Declaration of the Dey of Algiers, 'by
which:he bin& himself never, in case of any future 'wars
with any European power, to consign any of his pri-
soners to slavery ; but in all cases to treat them with
humanity, as prisoners of war, until re,gularly•exchanged,'

according to European practice in like cases; that, at
the termination of hostilities, they shall be restored to
their n.--spective oountrics without ransom. The Ga-
zette then preceeds to an account of the Apology, whieh
the Dey made to the British Consul ; with sn :account
•uftlse sum (3060 dollars) which he paid to him, as.a re-
muneration for depredations committed on his resi-
dence after his imprisonment. Then follows the case of
the two Spaniards, who bad been held in severe custody,
.on pretence, that they were prisoners for debt. Upon •
•enquiry, Lord Exmouth discovered, that this was a nwre
pretext, and 'he determined to make an effort in their
favour. After mach •tlifficulty, the Dey consented to
their liberation, but not till Lord Exmouth had threat-
wned a renewal of hostilities. This had the desired effect.
His Lordship's letters arc dated from Gibraltar, and an-
nounce his intention very 'shortly to return to England.
The retimded•ransonis have been sent to the Neapolitan
and 'Sardinian 'Governments, and the slaves, released,
'have been forwarded, in British transports, to their re-
spective countries.

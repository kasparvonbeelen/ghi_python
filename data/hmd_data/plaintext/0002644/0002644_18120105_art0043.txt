USAGE OF SLAVESâ€¢

Parliament is about to assemble, and amongst those national affairs
which will necessarily occupy their attention, we most fervently hope
that the present condition and-usage of the negroes in the West Indies
may not escape their consideration. By the passing of that Act, which
is a most memorable proof of the hobest and honourable zeal of Mr
Wilberforce, the Billfish Legislature evinced their desire to promote the
ultimate happiness of the whole human race; but neither that measure
nor the one subsequently furthered by Mr. Brougham has done aught to
better the condition of t hose who must continue slaves to the end cf their
existence. The slave trade, it is true, may be ab.dishedi but thousands
of negroes are still in a state of slavery in our West Indian plantations;
and so long as it is deemed pa/Ric to continue the chains around the
necks of those who are now staves in every sense of the word, for the
sake of suff.Ting humanity, let a law tie imposed by which the PLANT-
ERS shall be c impelled, at the peril of their own personal liberty, to treat
those in boimage to them as Christians ought to treat those that are,
from their hunib;e birth, necessit:sted to labour for their richer brothers!
Till such a law is passed, constantly shall we be *WMO4 to hear the

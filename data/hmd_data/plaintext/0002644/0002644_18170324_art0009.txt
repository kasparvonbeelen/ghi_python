THE NATII

any persons so fastidious, as to disapprove of extending
our colonial resources by conquest, we would bid them
look at the present abject and degraded state of the
Chinese, and reflect, that if conquest be necessary (a
eacumstance by no means to be inferred), the con-
querors will be Englishmen of the 19th century—the
&AMC men who have delivered France and Europe
from despotism—abolished Negro slavery—introduced
the Gospel of Peare into India—anti who, with a mag-
nanimity never equalled in the history of mankind,
have not only spared the lives, but assigned princely
revenues, to the greatest enemies the human race ever
saw, anti now their captives—the King of Candy and
Napoleon Buonaparte.

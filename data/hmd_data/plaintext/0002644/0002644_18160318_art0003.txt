MONDAY, MARCH 18, 1816.

labour of the six days is eagerly purchased, there is no
reason to doubt that the seventh (as Mr. Graham, the
author of the beautiful poem on the Sabbath, remarks)
would be purchased likewise if it were in the market, and
the labouring part of the community would be exposed
to unremitting unmitigated slavery.
Though, theretbre, our religion had done nothing else,
but said, " on the Sabbath thou shalt do no work; thou
nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, or thy
maid-servant," it would have conferred an invaluable
blessing on the world ; but it has gone farther, and has
provided the means of mental improvement, and moral
instruction, while it has secured an exemption from bodily
exertion. In other systems of worship we meet with
numerous festivals, in which the people were expected to
suspend the usual business of life, and surrender them-
selves to the calls of pleasure, or the exhibitions of super-
stitious pageantry. In the religion of the heathens, al-
most every divinity of importance had his appointed fes-
tival ; and the officers of the public were prohibited from
performing their usual public duties on the day when it
occurred.

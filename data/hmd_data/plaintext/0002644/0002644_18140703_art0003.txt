To slavery, under whatever denomination or colour it may
exhibit itself, we are, if we may be allowed the expression,
Enemies by instinct. But so long as we know it to be the
concomitant of power, and abstractedly to form a part of
every system of human legislation, so long as we have known

order of events that leaves something to rouse the dormant
faculties of mankind,and to give constant employment to the
active and consolatory pursuits of the heart.
We fear, however, if the question were narrowly scru-

A \YARNING TO ENGLAND.

"Let England remember the hour of her pide,
What the arms of her heroes made her,
What fields with the blood of her martyrs were dyed,
When the foes of her rights would invade her;
When she tore the sceptre from slavery's handâ€”
When her red cross was proudly streaming;
When she trampled in ashes the fiery brand
That in Rome's fierce grasp was gleaming.
When the world was in arms against her gates;
When against the world she thundered;
When her scale sustained earth's final fates;
When earth was saved and wondered;
When her people were fearless, and free and one,
And her church was a holy thing,
When her mighty throne was a Protestant throne,
And her King was the Protestant King.
Let England now think of the days to come,
When the sun of her glory shall set;
When her priests shall be sycophant slaves of Rome;
When her soil shall with blood be wet;
When Rome shall defile her holy walls;
When the proud idolater
With traitors shall sit in her council hall,
Then, England, thy death is near!"

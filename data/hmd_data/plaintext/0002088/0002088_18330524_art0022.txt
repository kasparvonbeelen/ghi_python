TUESDAY.

The gallery was not opened for the admission of strangers
till a quarter past 5 o'clock, in consequence of the balloting ior
committees upon the Montgomery and Dover elections being
appointed for to-day.
Mr. W. GLADSTONE presented a petition from the inhabi-
tants of Edinburgh and its vicinity, against negro slavery.
Sir W. INGILBY presented a petition from Gainsborough,
complaining of abuses in that corporation.â€”Referred to the
committee on corporations.
Mr. G. YOUNG, having been called on by the Speaker, said
he was unwilling to occupy the attention of -the house unneces-
sarily; but he considered the motion which stood on the pave r
of ttiat night, respecting the shipping interest, of so much im-
portance that he could not forego his right to bring it forward,
unless he received a distinct intimation from the- Vice-President
of the Board of Trade that he would endeavour to bring this
question under the consideration of the committee on trade
and manufactures at an early period, so that a report might be
presented to the house during the present session. (Hear,
h ear.)
Mr. P. TriomsoN assured the hon. gentleman that it was
his anxious desire that the question of the shipping interest
should form an early part of the committee's inquiry, and he
had very little doubt, from the course adoptedby the committee,
that such would be the case.
After a few more words, Mr. G. Young declined proceeding
with the motion of which he had given notice on this subject.

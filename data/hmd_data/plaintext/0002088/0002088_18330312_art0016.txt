SLAVERY.

Mr. F. BUXTON begged to say, in consequence of what had
fallen from the noble lord, the member for Buckinghamshire,
on a former evening, that he had not withdrawn his notice of
motion with regard to colonial slavery, which stoodior the 19th
instant. He would not withdraw it unless his Majesty's go-
verntiaent would come forward with a satisfactory measure upon
that subject, and no measure would be satisfactory that would
not embrace an entire and immediate abolition of slavery.—
Whatever measure government had to propose should be
brought forward immediately. Now that so many dangers
pressed with regard to the colonies,—now that there was a pro-
bability of a servile war unless this question was speedily set-
tled, no delay whatever should be interposed to obstruct that
settlement., and he would warn the West India proprietors not
to lose the opportunity which was now held out to them.

AUSTRIA.

VIENNA, DEC. 27.â€”A pamphlet printed elsewhere, "On
Reform in Hungary," was fur a short time spoken of here.
We pity the ill-informed, if they can for a moment be induced'
by such misrepresentation to believe; that injustice is in any
way done to Hungary. How willingly would the Emperor
remedy the most crying abuses, and the arbitrary abuses of the
magnates, or introduce a more humane system with respect to
the slavery of the peasantry, (for even vassalage is too mild a

chant vessels trading to that port. It was said this was iu con-
sequence of apprehensions being entertained of having, the
slaves smuggled away, and of the introduction of dangerous
opinions among them. Much public excitement prevailed at
Antigua, and the house of Assembly had presented an address
to the Governor upon the subject of seditious publications being
circulated, and of the general licentiousness of the press.
Showers of hail had fallen on several of the islands; and in
islartinique iu particular, where the temperature had been
unusually cold. At Barbadoes heavier rains bad fallen than

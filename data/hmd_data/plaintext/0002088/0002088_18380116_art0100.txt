THE NEGRO APPRENTICESHIP SYSTEM

TO THE EDITOR OF THE LIFERPOOL STANDARD

St accidentally attended a meetinginßirnlngh7ilTome
few days since, when the immediate emancipation of the negrues
in our West India Coloniei was strongly tirgbd by Messrs.
Sturge, Thompson, and others, and, in consequence, troubla,
you with a few ideas upon the subject, which, perhaps, you mai
think worthy a place in your columns. -- I am, Sir,
Your very obedient servant,
G. F. 13:

That freedom is every man's birthright, according, to the re;
vealed laws of our Divine Creator, and' that, consequently,
slavery, in any form, must -be a departure from the original de=
sign of that beneficent being, is a truth so palpable and so gene
rally admitted, that few in the present day would dispute it, as
abstract question, and amongst that few I am not ready td
enlist; but I think I am right in expressing nay opinion on the
state of the negroes in the British Colonies, in consequence of
attending a meeting of the friends of immediate emancipation
for the negro population in our foreign- dominiods, a step which;
after the great settlement of the question by the legislature, I
consider to be both unwise and impracticable. Whilst Ido not
yield to any individual amongst them one iota df svinpathv for
the distresses and•sufferings of the negroes, and whilst I abbot:
cruelty and oppression in any • and in every shape, gait.: as
heartily and as thoroughly as any of the adeocates, for immedi=
ate etnancipation can do, I really must state, that I heard, with
sorrow and regret, expressions towards the government, the
committees of the House of Commons, the stipendiary magis-
trates iu the West Indies, and towards ;he planters generally;
which I think no really humane and benevolent or thinking
I man could have uttered, without that excitement attendant on.
espousing a question, as a party question, where zeal generally
outruns discretion,'and where, even the boundary of truth is'
but too often disregarded in endeavourieg to make out a
case, and excite the feelings of an audience. The statements
of Mr. Sturge, in particular, should, on this account, be re-
ceived with great caution, because he is avowedly a warm
partizan, and his statements are considerably at variance with
many equally intelligent, and much longer residents, in Bri;
tish colonies, whose opportunities of judging are therefore
greater, and, who taking op the subject dispassionately, are
therefore the best judges of the matter, and it is not to be in-
ferred that Mr. Sturge, in his West Indian crusade, has not
laid hold of the very worst cases tie could select, the enormities,
of which are magnified, whilst that mild and kind treatment of
slaves, which most frequently attracted his notice, is carefully
concealed. The violent declamations of Mr. Thompson, who
began his address on so very serious and affecting a subject, by
a verse from "Old Mother Hubbard," must he taken for What
it was, a declamation well deliVered; but containing not a single
word of information, and totally unsupported by any thing in
the shape of evidence; hi's violent expressions against the go=
vernment, the stipendiary magistrates, and the planters, led me
to the conclusion that they were excluded from that universal
flow of philanthropy which he professed to feel fur all mankind,.
" over whose distresses he could pour out rivers of teats," whilst
it appears to me they are entitled to a participation in this. over-"
flow of sympathy on the following grounds:—
First, the ministry—They have grappled and settled a ques-
tion which for years has been regarded of paramount import=
ranee. which has been viewed with terror and dismay, as sur=
rounded with clouds and darkness by our most talented and
most benevolent statesmen-rnen heartily desirous of amelio-
rating the state of the negro slave—men, "with minds to
comprehend the universe," who have devoted, and most perse=
veringly devoted the efforts of their gigantic minds to lay down
a plan ; and yet, such have been the difficulties Which they had
to overcome, that they have devoted them in vain, although
success would have been with them the highest and dearest ob-
ject of life. At length a ministry, (and this one act will gild
their memory in future pages, when other names now illustrious:
will be forgotten) acting With the purest intentions, with good
advice, under mature deliberation, guided by noble and gene-
rous principles worthy of a great nation, accomplish what has
before been considered impracticable, and blending justice
with mercy, give a portion of the valtie which their legis-
lation takes from the planter, and give at a very short
date full and entire emancipation to the slave; including
in their act of mercy a clause that enforces upon' the planter to
build separate houses for the negroes before the time shall ar
rive when they will -cease to live in large bodies udder the
immediate care and chary,enf the proprietors That itith time
was necessary for such purposes, so that every poor ntan Might
take his wife and children to a dwelling when .they begin to
work as free labourers, " each providing for his own house=
hold, seems entirely to escape the. notice of theie ithmediate
emancipationists; whereas, in reality, it is one of the wisest and
most merciful regulations of the act, and fonts iu itself a suffi-
cient argument against immediately emancipating the negro,
and turning them from those roofs under which, by the old sys=
tem, they have enjoyed the protection and care of their Masters.
The continual agitation of this subject by no possibility pro-
duces any good, whilst its evil effects are hat sassing the govern=
merit, unsettling the mind of the negro. and keeping alive many
bitter feelings between the planter and the apprentices, which it
should be the object of every good man to bury in oblivion.
say the agitation is useless, because it is not within the bounds'
of probability to suppose that any alteration. in the law can
possibly take place before the date when full emancipation is to
be established, the general report upon the great trial from the
colonies being " that the System is working well."
On behalf of the stipendiary magistrates, I will be very brief;
having already exceeded the limits 1 at fist proposed; but, to
all who think of society in the West Indies, it must be obvious.
that these gentlemen, if they associate at all, must associate,
with the negro proprietors, or, in broad language, with " slave
owners." If they do so, the emancipationists complain that
they are biassed by friendship and acquaintance; whilst, on the,
other hand, if they keep totally alma from the planters; and re-
frain from familiar intercourse with the slave proprietors, their
circle of information mug, of necessity, he contracted and they
would lay open to the charge of prejudice the other WO', aria' Cer=.
tainly there would boairimafacteevidenceof such feeling; Wails&
the inference drawn by charitable minds is, that the planteis will
• join hand in hand to respect the law, with the .magistrates who'
are appointed to enforce it, and, therefore, the greater the has-.
mony which can be maintained bet weeti them, the more likely
is good to be adduced froth such associatiOns and connexions..
One word for the planters, and I will conclude. The grant of
twenty millions does certainly appear an astounding and enor-
mous sum of money to give as compensation, but taking it at
so much per head, whithi after all, is the only 'fair way to judge
of its amount, it does not come to' one half the value of the'
slave in the average of the colonies, and in the other fo'nof one
tliird, and this is the Only way to estimate the amount of the
grant. If for any purpose of general benefit it *as enacted in
this country, that any particular description of property which
it had been legal to hold, should cease k) be an after a lapse of.
three or tour years, and the legislature arwarded one half of
the amount of that property to be paid to the owners as corn-.
[
pensatinn for their new law, although the amount might be one'
hundred millions, the parties receiving it would naturally say,.
and be right in saying, that they were loiters, and the enormoug
amount of the grant would not destroy the fact—let Pianos% to
, the planter what,,under a similar opeiatian of law rive ShOnld
claim ourselves, and thereby carry into practiee the great
Christian-precept, " Whatsoever ye would that erten ihouid do'
unto you—do ye also unto them,- and it should never be lost
sight of in looking at this question, that the holding of Slaves has'
been encouraged by succeeding kings and governments—that
under this system our Wept India colonies have grown to their
preset-if amazing productiienes's, and feat the slavery in the
abstract is detestable, and
reto ncil ia ble to thee,,,ehiestatreyr

sanctinned by law, and taken on the average, has not presented
more cruelties, and hardships, than are to be selected frOm the'

Vie Age of Intellect, A Satire, written in the Dog-

Daiis. By Melopuins. London: Mitchell, 1537...
There are some very excellent points in this pleasant
satire. The language and composition throughout is
classically accurate, and the wit and truth which pervade
every line render it a poem of no ordinary attractions.

The Sportsman. January, 1837.
The present number of this truly spirited magazine is
by no, means inferior to any of its predecessors. This is
accompanied by two eicelient plates, one of which is a
portrait of Mango, the winner of the Doncaster St. Leger
in 1837, and the other a view of ," Wild Ducks Dis-
turbed." Both are admirably executed. The, articles -in
the present number areas varied and as spirited as nsual.
Our sporting friends will find in them an ample fund of
amusement.

The Farmer's Magazine, and Monthly Journal of Pro-
ceedingg affecting the Agricultural Interest. Janu-
ary, 1839.
This is truly a splendid number of this national maga-
zine, which may be considered a repertory of all that is
essentially useful to the farmer. The articles are char-
acterised by their usual ability, and will be found of
'essential value to the practical agriculturist.

We have seldom met With a more interesting number
of this truly amusing niagazine. The poetry,. tales, and
g enet at selection f light reading, of which it iscomposed,
render it one of the most enchanting miscellanies of the
day. The pt:esent number is illustrated by the usual
plates of fashions, superadded to which %ye have a beauti-
ful portrait of her Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria.

Nitrogen - gas is remarkable for the number of combinations
into which it enters with oxygen gas. Nitrous oxide. (the first
of its five combinations) was discovered, by Priestley; but its
properties having been analyzed by Sir H. Davy, be may,
with more propriety, be said to have .deserved that honour. If
.we saturate ammonia with nitric acid, we obtain a salt called
nitrate of,ammonia. When this •tralt. is heated in asretort, we
-find it melts, and, as it is fused, effervesces, and the whole of it
passes off in the form of nitrous oxide and water. The nitric
acid is said to consist of fiveequivaleuts of o:;ygen. and one of
nitrogen. Ammonia consists of one equivalent of nitrogen and
two of hydrogen... portiOn of the .oxygen and the hydrogen
unite together to form water, and the temaining oxygen unites
with the nitrogen to compose nitrousoxide. Nitrouaoxideis co-
lourless,transparent,and incapable of acting on vegetablecolours.
It is one and a half tiinea as heavy as atmospheric air. If a light- •
ed taper is introduced into a jar of it, it Will burn with nearly
as Much brilliancy as in oxygen; but if the taper be peeSionsly
extinguished, it will not be relighted as in oxygen. Nitrous
oxide has become very remarkable in science, on account of
the influence it exercises upon the animal system when respired.
It shay-be known to some, that -the 'first. fifti:o'duction of 'Sir
l-lnmphrey Davy to public life, was the establishment of an in-
stitution iu for the recovery of persons in certain dis-
eases by the iuspiration of different gases. A well-known phys
aici in was led to suppose, that the appearance of too much red
in the faces of roosumptive persons indicated the presence of
toaanurh oxygen ; and he thought, that by respiring A. gas-con-
tnittiog less oxygen, the •patient might be cured.- This led' to
the respiration of the different leases, but only one gave any re-
markable result. In the respiration of nitrous Oxide, there is
felt a most agreeable species-of. intoxication, ands altogethersa
sense of great delight is produced; which is, however, but mo-
mentary, in which respect it differs from the ordinary species of
iotirxitation, in not leaving- behind it any trace of weakness.
Davy was the first to find oat this property of the gas. A very
great. differenee takes place in the. effector' the gesnpon the
various persons inhaling it. It happened that the-assoctates of
Davy were then of a highly imagnialice aws poetical tempera-
ment. It is well known that Davy himself would have been one
of our lirst-rate•poetS, had he not been our leading philosopher.
Consequently, the effects of the gas upon these individuals was
pectiliarly energetic. A singular instance of the-force of ima-
gimiation happened at Paris at the time of ttia discovery or the
intoxicating powers of this gas. A French. ellemist 'was pre-
vailed upon to administer it on a certain dery to a number of his
friends. Having previously prepared his 'ins in bladders; he
sent his assistant into his laboratory for it when required. The
company all respired it and became intoxicated. The next
marning, on going into his laboratory, the'chetnist found that
his assistant had brought him bladders filled with' atmospheric
air instead of those containing the nitrous oxide.
Nitric oxide contains one more equivalent of. oxygen than
nitrous oxide. . We cannot form it by the direct combination of
nitrogen with oxygen. It we place nitric acid, which contains
most oxygen of alt the combinations of nitrogen, in combivation
with a metal, the nitriesacid is reduced to the situation of nitric
oxide. For this purpose, we may take tin, copper; or quick-
silver. The acid requires to be used somewhat weak, otherwise
a portion. of the oxide would be distilled. over in the state of
nitrous oxidh, or even in the state. of .nitrogen. - It is. remark-
able, in having almost time same density as atmospheric air, it
consists of equal volumes of oxygen and azote, or two equiva-
lents of oxygen and one of note. if we allow a quantity of
atmospheric air to pass into a jar containing the nitric oxide, a
quantity of dense red fumes arise, which is.not the case with any
other gas. This is a perfect test for nitric oxide. Nitric oxide
resembles nitrous oxide very.nearly. in its power of supporting
combustion. Unless a body be in a state of powerful intlamtna-•
tion, it will not burn in it, hut ii that state it will burn with equal.
brilliancy as in oxygen gas.- The reason why it. behaves in this
way towards coinbustiltre bodies is simple. Its elements are held
together by a very feeble .affinity. A body which is:burning
slightly is nut able to decompose it, and is therefore extinguished;
but the gas being decomposed by the beat-of burning phosphorus,
the phosphorus burns with great brilliancy in the oxygen which
is set tree. sulphuret of carbon be thrown into a jar of nitric
oxide, in the proper quantity, and.a taper applied to the mouth
of the jar, a most brilliant combustion ensues. It is an experi-
ment which does' -not -always -succeed, but Dr. Kane per-
formed it very beautifully. Nitric oxide has been used in'en-
dioinetry to indicate the proportions of oxygen in atmospheric
air., but it is found not to lead to any accurate results.. If the
red fumes which this gas presents upon being mixed .with at-
mospheric air be absorbed by water, they will be found to pos-
sess acid properties.
ll},ponitrous acid cannot be obtained except in combination
With nitrous and. nitric oxide. We only know ti few of' its 'salts.
If we take commou saltpetre, and beat it to a dull redness until
it ceases to give put oxygen gas, and then examine it, we shall
find it to be hyponarite of potash, the Li're having given out
two-Gabs of its oxygen.
The most iaiportaut of the co- mPaiinds of nitrogen and oxygen
is nitric acid, which can be made in a Variety of ways. rts
composition was determined by Faraday in a very'extraordinary
manner. He took a quantity of nitrate of- potash, and put it
in a tube containing atmospheric • air, and passed' a set ins of
electric sparks through it, so as to produce crystals. Every day
the formation of nitric arid is going on in the atmospheric air.
Rain water, particularly that which, falls wrier thunder stattms,
is found to contain nitrate of ammonia. From the ox•periments
of Cavendish this formation takes place on'A Large scale doing
a thunder storm-. By the action of the flash of lightning' sue
have the oxygen and the nitrogen of the air formed into nitric
acid, and ammonia being so generally set free-during- the de-
composition of bodies, the, nitric acid unites itself with this-hose.
If we mix mortar wilh organic boilies, and expose •thern to the
action of the atmosphere, we shall find thitt,afier a certain time
the mass will effloresce, and we shall get from it a considerable
quantity- of nitrate of potash. lii some countries a process simi-
lar to this takes place spontaneously, thus our nitrate of
potash is the result of a natural_ efloreseence which .takes
place upon the surface of the earth, iu the- -East Indies,
and our . nitrate Of-soda, is the result of a similar process
t:f nature carried on .in South Atnerlea.. The salts Of
nitric acid are prepared in. this way by nature •or art. The
preuaration of nitric acid, is carried bu for minuet-in:a pur-
poses from the decomposition or nitrate of. potash. The ni-
trate of potash, which consists of nitric acid and pettish, is dis-
tilled with sulphuric acid. The sulphuric acid takes the potash
from the nitric acid, and the nitric acid takes-the watesaviaah
hits been united with the sulphuric acid. Thus we have sulphate
of _potash and. nitrate of water. Nobody has ever seen nitric
acid by itself. butaiwars inaSoMbinalian Other bodies ; and
what. is obtained in ,shops
.is neither inure' nor less than nitric
acid- and Water. Nitric acid contains five equivalents of oxygen,
and it is remarkable for the'facility with which it yields oxygen,
and in consequence. whenever we Avant to oxyd-t2e. bodies we
make use of it, and the acid itself is reduced to the state of nitric
oxide, and 'frequently to the state of nitrogen. The action of
nitric arid upon tin produces nitric oxide, T here is no more
certain test for nitric acid than the evotution i,f these red fumes
from it by contact with metalic substances

NEW AND IMPORTANT SUBSTITUTE Colt WOOD ENGRAV-
ING.—We have this week had submitted to.us, a vary ingeni-
ous discovery made by a gentleman of the natne of Wtione, the
NH influence of which, on the arts and manufactures of the
country, it is difficult at this moment to foresee. The new art,
for:which Mr. Woone -has taken out a‘ patent, is called Metallic
Relief Engraving, and will,,it is believed in a great degree,
supersede, wood engraving. The principal advantages of wood
engraving, as is well known, are the comparative :cheapness Of
printing; andtthe facility it affords of taking impressions from
the engraved block, along with the letter-press, at one operation,
and without much additional expense. The cost of engraving,
however, is considerable, and while all advantages are believed
to be in common between the new and the old method, the great
cost of engraving is saved by. Dl r. Woone's discovery. The
new process may he thus briefly' described. Prepared plaster
of Paris laid on a smooth surface of metal, is the material on
which the artist etches the subject he proposes to have engraved.,
with a steel point, as it were—and this drawing or etching is
at once cast in metal. it must be obvious, that the time occu-
pied for producing a design by this meihod, barely exceeds that
required by the artist to sketch with his pencil ou,the block of
wood, previous to its being put into the hands of the engraver,
so that nearly the whole labour and expense of engraving the
design on the block is saved. Wood engravings, too; cannot
be executed on a large scale; whereas, by this process, reliefs
may be obtained of any size, Another great ad vantoge is, that
the design does not require to be reversed, as in ordinary en-
, graving, but is drawn t same way as it is afterwards in appear,
Hon the paper, which renders this niethnd'paiticularly applicable
to works in which writing occurs, as maps, plans, &c. The
method is applicable to all relief work, including the blocks
employed for the printing of cotton, paper hangings, &a.
We are not, however, so fascinated it, jib this new art, as to be
without some misgivings as 10 the ictssibility of its 11V:tiling
wood. engraving in certain effects Mr. Woone's tirrangements
fur undertaking woiks win shortly be completed, when we shall
Lave an opportunity of testing its power, and our readers shall
Judge for theraselves.-4thenceum.

THE Foci IN LONDoN.—At an early hour on Friday morning
a beavy'fo. came on, which continued Unabated nearly through
the day. The fog pervaded with equal denseness every part of
the metropolis, and candles and gas-lights were every where in
requisition just as if. it were the dusk of evening. • About four
o'clock the hackney coaches left the stands, and many of the
cabs and omnibuses ceased running; but some drivers walked
their horses, having torches carried before them. The Grave-
send, Greenwich, and Woolwich steamers ceased to run during
the \thole day,
,and set eral vessels on their waS' to London
brought up at Gravesend. A number of steam-ships from the
cout:neut and various parts of the'United Kingdom were unable
to reach the pool,.it not 'being considered safe to attempt to
bring-them up. About eleven, Mr. henry Pilkington,-a gen-
tleman bet ween forty and -fifty >ears of age, of the firm of
kit-Ivan and IlandalOtristle merchants;residing- in Southwark,
engaged a wee-ratan in puthim•Ow board a vesselAin the pool,
but from the denseness of the tog the' boat' tan on tt' ship's cable,

HOUSE OF COMMONS.--FRIDAY.

Mr. B. HOY moved (as an amendment on the motion for
going into committee of supply), an address to his Majesty to
secure the fulfilment of the existing treaty between this coun-
try and Mexico, and to prevent the establishment of slavery,
and the traffic in slaves in the province of Texas. He strongly
urged the adoption of some proceeding, as the war carrying on
in Texas was not one for liberty and independence, but for
slavery. He thought that this country ought to protect the
Mexicans.

Mr. Weep seconded the motion, contending that the slave-
holding and the non-slave holding states were pretty nearly
balanced; if Texas became annexed to the union, the slave
holding voices would be the more powerful in that " land of
liberty."

Laid PALMERSTON said that he could not agree to the ad-
dress. The government were most anxious to put an end to
the evils of slavery. The annexation of Texas to the United
States would, undoubtedly, be an important event, but he
thought that at present there was no probability of it.â€”The sub-
ject then dropped.

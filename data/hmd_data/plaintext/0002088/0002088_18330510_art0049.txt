IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.

HOUSE OF LORDS, WEDNESDAY.
Marquis CAMDEN presented a petition from the clergy of Can-
terbury against the Irish church temporalities bill. .
As the bill was not before the house, the petition was with:
drawn.

' The Earl of R ADNOR presented the report of the select com-
mittee on the Stafford bribery bill, and would take that oppor-
tunity of correcting a mistake in a statement into which he had
fallen when he last addressed the house upon the subject. He
had then stated that out of 526 who had voted for Capt. Gronow,
524 had been paid for their votes. Some gentlemen from Staf-
ford had called upon him, and set him right upon the subject ;
they stated to him that they, and many other respectable gen,
tlemen, had voted for the Captain, and when they met, after.
such a statement had been made, they were most anxious to
know who were the two virtuous men. Since that communica-
tion had been made to him, he had looked over the list, and
counted those voters who were marked, and found that he had
stated the number 100 too many ; it should have been 424 out of
526. He moved that the report be printed, and the second read-
ing of the bill be fixed for Friday next, and that their lordships
be summoned for that day.
The Earl of Albermarle presented petitions for the total and
immediate abolition of slavery, chiefly from parishes in Bed-
fordshire.

The personal estates bill and the cotton duty bill were read a
second time, and committed for to-morrow; and the bills brought
up from the commons were read a first time.
The house then adjourned.

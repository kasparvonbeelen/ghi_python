c oaimgrff.l.," Lot tlr, who voted with Mr. Grote because

on Mr. Grote's loyalty, and come to the conclusion that
grapes do not grow on thistles ; they will remember that

" Who swore at first to fight
For the King's safety and his right,
And after marched to find him out,
And charged him with horse and foot,
• But yet had still the confidence
To swear it teas in his defence."
The learned doctor adopts a different course. No
fighting for him ; but the effect of the King's name must
be counteracted. "I will filch his good name from him,"
sa,ys the doctor. "Yes, if I cannot say he is with me I
will paint him in such•colours that no honest man will
venture to vote on the King's side. Slander shall be my
weapon—

"‘ Slander,
Whose edge is sharper than the sword; whose tongue
Outvenoms all the worms of Nile; whose breath
Rides on the posting winds, and doth belie
All Corners of the world: kings, queens, and states,
Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave,
My viperous slander enter's."'

Thank God there is every reason to believe that the
bane will prove its own antidote, and that' the doctor's
slander will lead to his well•merited dismissal from the
Tower Hamlets.

°What says " Old Glory ?" "I cannot afford to lose
the King's name. No, I will have recourse to the fol-
lowing artifice:—Until my election is over I will main-
tain that there has.been back-stairs influence ; that the
King has been cajoled ; that in his heart he is opposed to
the change which-has taken place."
".These lies are like the father that begot them," and
the respectable part of the reformers of Westminster are
more dull than we take them to be if Sir Francis can
succeed in persuading them that the late change in the
adibinistration was not the'sole and uninfluenced act of
biS Nest gracious Majesty. •
The few specimens we have given will suffice to show
what kind of use such men will make of the King's name.

WEST INDIES.

The following extract from an American paper, the Pennsyl-
vanian Inquirer, of the 26th November, affords matterfer serious
reflection and the must melancholy anticipation. Who is there
that can rise from the perusal of it without deeply feeling the
mischiefs of that reckless precipitancy of legislation which is
continually urged upon us as a proof of talent and activity, but
which has, notwithstanding, laid a tremendous hurthen on the
mother country, and reduced the colonies to the condition here
ilestribed :
" We a day or two since had a call from a Jamaica planter,
who is now on a visit to the United States with the object of
purchasing a farm, and settling here. His picture of the pro-
spects of the British West Indies is melancholy indeed. It is
buba short time since he left Kingston, and at ::.at time the
white population laboured under the most dreadful apprehen-
sions of revolt—apprehensions that were strengthening every
day. The planters consider the act of the British government
for the emancipation of the negroes as discreditable in almost
every sense. They denounce it as an act of legalised villanv •
because, even should they receive the twenty millions voted
parliament as compensation for their slaves, they consider this
sum as equivalent to but one-third of the actual value of their
property. It is computed that there are eight hundred thou-
sand slaves in the several islands, and if, as is intended, twenty
millions sterling shall be divided amongst the owners, at so
much per head for each slave, without reference to the -age or
sex, the computation will be about £25 per head. The planters
value them as worth £75 per head, and consider, therefore, even
if they receive the compensation money, which is extremely
doubtful, they will lose two-thirds of the real value 'of their
slaves, besides utterly sacrificing their plantations,;_ -for-no one
will purchase them at any price, and without the slaves to cal-•
tivate them they are, in fact, worth nothing. The crop, of the
present year, both of sugar and rum, is expected not to amount
to more than one-third of the usual crop, and it is believed, that
long before 1840, when the slaves will be free by the lithitation
of the apprenticeship act, they will refuse'to work at all, and if
any attempt is made to coerce them, AnothCr rebellion will
ensue. The planters and white inhabitants generally are col-
lecting as much valuable property together as possible, with the
object of either emigrating to this • country, or returning to
England, although many of them, utterly incensed at the course
'of the mother country with regard to them, have determined
never to revisit their shores. They argue in this way—we are
as much opposed to slavery in the abstract and on principle as
any other portion of our fellow men ; but we became planters,
purchased negroes under the faith of our government, supposing
that if any law of emancipation should be adopted, the rights
of the landholder would not he jeopardised, or at all events, if
compelled to dispose of, or forsake his property, that he would
be adequately remunerated by the government. But how does
the -case stand ? We have been suddenly robbed of our pie-
-perry; and not only this but the lives of the white population of
the Islands have been endangered, and to what end ? Certainly
slot to ameliorate the c'indition of the blacks; for, before the
adoptioasof the Emancipation Law, they. were the happiest
peasantry in the world; wit heat- a care—without a want- But
now they are already plunging into idleness and intemperance,
and, as soon 'as they are fully emancipated, will commence cut-
tingeaeli other's th Gass.
"The islands Wilt be ilestroyed—a b!oody drhasty will be
erected, and the philanthropists who, with the best and ,purest
intentions, no doubt, proposed the Act of Emancipation, will
reproach themselves as the authors of all the carriage and
wretchedness that must ensue.

On Tuesday-the long-expected case of Hodgens r. Mahon,
brought against the defendant fur criminal conversation with
the piaintiff's wile,: was brought on for trial in the Court of
King's Bench, Dublin. The damages were laid at £10,090.
From the statement of the opposite counsel and the evidence
of the plaintiff the circumstances appear to be as follows
1819 M. 0.: H. Walker, a wealthy lottery-office keeper, died,
leaving. his affairs in such a state that several laid claim to his
property. A statement of the claims was submitted to Mr.
Hodgens, a young barrister, about twenty-two years of age,
awl he gave his opinion that the rightful claimant was Miss
Walker, niece of the deceased, a young lady then only twelve
years of age, and educating at a boarding-school, having pro-
perty to the amount of £12,000, in consequence of which she
had been made a ward of Chancery. Mr. Hodgens, who was
the son of a respectable tradesman, obtained an introduction to
Mrs. Walker, the personal guardian of the young lady; and
afterwards he had three interviews' with the daughter. The
first interview he brought her a pocket-full of sweetmeats, and
the next time he went he brought her a quantity of fruit, which
she partook of very cheerfully ; the third interview was con-
clusive. • The young lady consented to exchange her doll for a
husband, and changed from a little boarding-school girl to a
contented matron. She was brought by Mr. Hodgens and a
Mr. Eiphinstone to Smithfield, where they were married by
the notorious couple-beggar, Mr. Woods. (Laughter.) After
this she returned to her boarding-schoOl, and he to his house in
Fitzgibbon-street. These interviews and the marriage all took
place within the space of eight days. A few months after the
circumstances.were related to the Court of Chancery, and Mr.
Hodgeus was thrown into prison, but released ou promising to
have no more intercourse with the minor, the marriage itself
being null by the absence of consent on the part of the guardian
of the property. Notwithstanding this promise -he corresponded
with the child, and in five weeks he had her brought to his
residence, where she remained with him for the night. 'The
governess: complained to the Chancellor, and he was again
imprisoned; but he obtained his discharge by filing a hill,
alleging that the child of her own accord left the seminary.
Matters lay dormant till May, 1822, when he carried her off as
she was promenading with-her school-fellows ; and fearing the
vigilance of the Chancery officers he actually got a friend to
pack him in a cask, labelled pickled pork, and to put him on
board a- London vessel, in-which Mist Walker also embarked.,
From London they went to Dunkirk, where he and his com-
panion lived-. for seven-years, his father allowing him £l5O a
year. Their-mode of living -was, -however, very spare, and•the
young lady was compelled -to snbmit to some unexpected de-
gradations. In the interval the- cause relative tot-her.uncle's
property was decided; and on their return in 1827, when she
was of age, she was put in possession of A:75,000. • Hitherto
they had' been living in a state of concubina,geT"arra- ..nir a
formal marriage took place; the lady observing to her friends,
" Hew could 1, after living so long with him under such cir-
nu. any unto, unless deter-
mined to forfeit all claim to the respect of society." -A splendid
mansion in Stephen's-green was taken, and magnificent dinners
were giien, and the usual course of fashionable amusements
engaged in; in short, the happiness of both appeared to the
But after Mrc t.,5
husband two' chitdren nit conduct "became altered ; he made a
mistress of the housemaid, and his wife he not only abused but
Cruelly beat. •In January, 1834, Mr. Mahon, a surgeon-in the
Royal Artillery, and a relation of O'Gorman Mahon, was in-
troduced to Mr. Hodgens, and by him invited to Stephen's-
green: It would appear that a close intimacy speedily sprung
up: between Mr. Mahon and Mrs. Hodgens. Her:husband
took no notice of this; and at a bali at the Castle she was, at
the instance`of her husband, attended by• Mr. Mahou, and by,
him presented to the Viceroy. This attracted general observa-
tion; and the plaintiff observed, "Why, everyone is remarking
that you two look like man and wife, and that if you are not
you soon will be." Some subsequent occurrences at length
roused Mr. Hodgens' suspicions ; and his wife, on being informed
of them, left the house, complaining of her husband's ill-treat-
ment. She, however, returned on his consenting to give her
the entire controul of her property (£2500 a year,) with the
exception of £4OO a year; but a dispute arising she again left
him, and lodged in a 'house where Mr. Mahon visited her, and
where the criminal conversation was proved to have taken
place. It is proper to add that Mr. Hodgens's father was a
wealthy man, but died without leaving a shilling to his son,
with whom he had quarrelled. The- lady is said to, possess
great personal attractions.
Such are the facts of this extraordinary case as we have
collected them from the reports in the Irish papers of the
deuce and the speeChes of counsel.
Mr. Litton and Mr. O'Connell, M.P., appeared for the
Plaintiff, and Mr. Bennett and Mr. Jackson for the defendant.
At a late hour on Thursday night Mr O'Connell replied on
the part of Hodgens; and the jury, after twenty minutes de-
liberation, returned a verdict for the plaintiff—Damages three •
thousand pounds. and sixpence costs.
The trial occupied three days.

" We trust, si,ncerely, that these anticipations may never be
realized, and give them as those of men who. are incensed at
the conduct of the British government, and whose feelings,
may, perhaps, give a colouring to their predictions; but we
confess we have fears of their realization. The experience is
one involving important results, especially for the people of
this. country. Should the emancipated negroes of the 'West
India islands prove themselves capable of self-government, and
carry out to the fullest perfection the views of the zealous and
persevering men who agitated the subject, something would,
no doubt, be immediately attempted with regard to the slaves
of the United States.

"'Let us pause, therefore, for the result in the case of the
West Indies, and profit by the acts of the statesmen and phi-
lanthropists of the old world, before we attempt to meddle with
so delicate a subject at home."

Silr William H. Follett, the present solicitor-general, was
called to the bar in the year 1821, having practised, fora short
time only, about two years, as a special pleader previously. The,
learned gentleman was a member of Trinity College, Cam-
bridge, but while there did not apply himself to the acquisition
of any university honuurs. With the exception of that.of the
late Lord Gifford, we are justified in stating that the rise of the
present solicitor-general has been the most rapid ever known at
the bar. The present attorney-general, who was also of Trinity
College, Cambridge, graduated m the year 16, having pre-
viously obtained the honourable clistioction of being second.
wrangler.

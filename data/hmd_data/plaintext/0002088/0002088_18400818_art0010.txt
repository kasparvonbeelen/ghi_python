A girl of five years, the daughter of a man named Coree,
was attacked and severely bitten in the leg by a large eel,
while bathing at Barnahard, near Kilrush, on Saturday last.
The child was saved from further injury by a young man ivho
was raising sand near the spot, and who compelled the fish
to retire by inflicting on it a severe blow with his shovel.—
Limerick Chronicle.
There is a laboratory in London, in the Museum of Econo-
mic Geology, attached to the boards of Woods and Forests,
to which any individual may send one pound of any soil of
which he wishes to know what are the ingredients, and for a
small fixed fee obtain an exact analysis of the same, con-
ducted by Mr. Phillips, whose name has long been in the first
'rank of the analytical chemists of Europe.
THR BATTLE OF WATERLOO.—A singular calculation has
been made relative to the 2,000 officers engaged in that me-
morable event. There are now living and serving- in the
army 1 field-marshal, 5 generals, 21 lieutenant-generals, 31
major-generals, 81 colonels, 123 lieutenant-colonels, -82 ma-
jors, 108 captains, lieutenants, quarter-masters, and sur-
geons, which, with 200 killed or died of wounds, and 1348
sold out, died, retired, &c., make up the 2000.
SHORT WEIGHT " FOR THE ENGLISH."—A few days
singe a baker at Boulogne was cited before the authorities to
answer the charge of having sold .bread of deficient weight.
The baker did not deny the charge, but pleadedin extenua-
tion that he made it a point of conscience never to sell &loaf
of light weight to the French : he disdained, he said, to rob
any of his countrymen ; no, the loaves that " were weighed
and found wanting" were manufactured only for the English ;
oui, seulement pour les Angiais.
BEAUMONT BARONY.—On Tuesday, in the House of
Lords, shortly before the prorogation, the Lord Chancellor
presented the report from the committee for privileges, setting
forth " That the petitioner, Miles Thomas Stapleton, Esq.,
had made out his claim as one of the co-heirs of the Beau-
montbarony." The report was agreed to, and resolved and
adjudged accordingly ; and the resolution and judgment were
ordered to be laid before her Majesty by the' Lords, with
`white staves.

INFANT SLAVERY IN ENGLAND.-Mr. Commissioner
Tuffnall, after detailing the distressing nature of pinmaking,
says, "My inquiries fully corroborated the account of its
being the practice of parents to borrow sums of money on the
credit of their children's labour, and then let them nut to
pin-making till it is paid. One woman had let out both her
children for ten months, and another had sold her's for a
year." What is this but infant slavery ? And what an
epitome does it furnish of the rottenness and injustice of our
social system.—Leeds Intelligencer.
It is not, we believe, generally known why publicans have
the chequers painted on their door-posts. • The following an-
ecdote will, however, show it:—The arms of the Earl of
Warren and Surrey were the chequers. This family, being
allied to William the Conqueror, had from him the exclusive
power of granting licenses for selling malt liquor; and to
enable their agents to collect the consideration money more
readily, the door-posts were painted with their arms, which
practice has been handed down to the present day. This
privilege is said to have been exercised by their descendants,
the Earls of Arundel, as late as the reign of Philip and
Mary.

An application was made some days since to the Marquis
of Normanby for a commutation, or rather remission, of the
sentence on the young gentleman named Medhurat, who is
under sentence of three, /ears' imprisonment for the man-
slaughter of hit schoolfellow at Hillingdon. The refusal was
a decided negative on the merits. He has, therefore, some-
what more than a year and a-half of his term of imprison-
ment to serve. He is allowed, however, under proper re-
strictions, to occupy himself in what is called the engineer's
room with a lathe, as he has a strong mechanical turn, and
manufactures toys, such as chessmen, and similar articles.
He seems much subdued in spirit, and conducts himself very
submissively.

HOSPITAL FOR MERCHANT SEAMEN.—The prorogation
of parliament affords us space for the consideration of mat-
ters of perhaps equal importance to many of those discussed
in that assembly. One of the greatest, is a project for found-
ing an institution for the relief of aged or disabled merchant
seamen—a sort of Greenwich Hospital, with the option of
being relieved in their own localities,' if they prefer it. This
is a noble idea, and one most loudly called for. Merchant
seamen, the chief promoters of our national wealth, the best
bulwarks of our national power, the sole source of manning
our navy whenever occasion requires, are left in their old age
to die like dogs in ditches, or handed over to the tender-mer-
cies of the poor-laws. Really this is a scandal to our govern-
ment and our country. The press-gang, with all its horrors,
was a blessing to many, compared with the present state of
things. A sailor by being pressed and serving seven or eight
years in the Navy did earn for himself ad asylum in his old
age; but what can he do now? Where now is the institu-
tion that will receive him when no longer able to work for
his living? We are glad to hear that many members of both
houses of parliament have expressed their intention of sanc-
tioning and supporting this plan, and that it has been dis-
cussed by many of the corporations of maritime towns, the
chief magistrates of which have written to express their ap-
probation of it, including the Lord Mayor of Dublin, the
Mayors of Newcastle, Sunderland, Durham, Southampton,
Chester, Dartmouth, Exeter, Birmingham, Sandwich, Har-
wich, and Gravesend. With such support its success may
be calculated upon, and we cannot help. thinking that when
carried into operation it will contribute to ►core • prudent
habits among our seamen, and wean them from the services
of other states, offering them no such advantages. Why not
unite a sailors' savings bank with the other contemplated ob-
jects ?—Morning paper.
A device was planned by a Jew, nicknamed Buffy, who
was, and possibly is still, a very active agent in illicit tran-
sactions. Some hundreds of tubs were prepared at Boulogne,
their shape and colour being altered and disguised by a coat-
ing of Paris plaster, studded here and there with gravel, shells,
or sea-weed, so that they resembled lumps of chalk, such as
are found under cliffs upon the coast of Kent. A cargo of
spirits, in tubs of this description, was carried across to Dover
during the night, and dropped upon the sands above low-
water mark, so as to be dry when the tide receded. The boat
then put off to sea and disappeared ; and soon after day-break
one of the smugglers, attired in a carter's gaberdine, with a
long ship upon his shoulder, drove carelessly past the blockade
sentinel, proceeded down across the sands, and leisurely
loaded his cart with what seemed lumps of chalk, intended
for burning into lime ; he then laid a few pieces of real chalk
over the top, drove again past the sentinel into the fields,
where the cart was unloaded in a twinkling, and the operation
repeated, till every cask had been conveyed to -a place of
safety. As no boat appeared in this affair, and but one per-
son attended the cart, there was nothing in the least likely to
attract attention, and to excite the suspicion of the sentinel.
The scheme accordingly succeeded so well that it might have
escaped detection altogether had not the secret been dis-
covered to one of the officers in the Coast Blockade service.
—United Service Journal.

EARLY RISING.—Next to temperance, a quiet conscience,
a cheerful mind, and active habits, I place -early rising as a
means of health and happiness. I have hardly words for the
estimate I form of that sluggard, male or female, that has
formed the habit of wasting
theeth early prime of day in bed.
Putting out of the question po loss of life, and that
too of the most inspiring and beautiful part och day.,
when all the voices of nature invite man from his bed; leav-
ing out of the calculation, that longevity has been almost
invariably attended by early rising ; to me late hours to bed
i
present an index to character, an d an omen of file ultiate
hopes of the person who indulges in this habit. There ism no
mark so clear of a tendency to self-indulgence. It denotes
an inert and feeble mind, infirm of purpose, and incapable of
that elastic vigour of will which enables the posessor to
accomplish what his reason ordains. The subject of this
unfortunate habit cannot but have felt self-reproach, and a
purpose to spring from his repose with the freshness of dawn.
If the mere indolent luxury of another hour of languid indul-
gence is allowed to overrule this better purpose, it argues a
general weakness of character, which promises no high
attainment or distinction. These are never awarded by for
tune to any trait but vigour, promptness, and decision.--
Viewing the habit of late rising, in many of its aspects,
would seem as if no being that has any claim. to rationalit3
could be found in the allowed habit of sacrificing a tent}
and that the freshest portion of life, at the expense of healti
and the curtailing of the remainder, for any pleasure that Oa
indulgence could coufer.—Flint.

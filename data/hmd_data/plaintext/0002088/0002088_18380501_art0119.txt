THE STATE OF TRADE r. THE NEWSPAPER
ACCOUNTS.
(From the Manchester Courier.) .•
several months it was .our practice to insert wiekly
"fieed
unts of the state of trade in Manahester, which, it is
unnecessary to explain, we gleaned from variou. parties
"on change." The generdrithis'afiWaction, however,
expressed both by merchants and manufacturers, together
•
with the conviction that such notices—conveying, as
they did, the feelings and opinions (in some instances,
no doubt, biassed ,by circumstances) of a few individuals,
roust be injurious to trade, at length induced us to with-
draw them-entirely from our columns. And it is obvi-
ous that Unless a chamber, composed of merchantS and
.manufacturers,. were established, the sense of which
should be periodically taken and given to the public, a
true and exact representation of the state of trade must
heinite impracticable..
" We have been led to these observations by the perusal
of the following paragraph, which- appeared in the Guar-
- dici*OflVddneMy
- •.‘.' There was a decided appearance or improvement in our
:market yesterday. The demand for yarns, and for most des-
,criptions, of pri,nling cloths, was better than for some weeks
past'; and a trilling advance on previons rates was, in some
rpses, realised.. Thegeneral opinion appeared to be, that prices
tiatte.allenglii seen their lowest, and there was consequently a
Much more healthy feeling than has prevailed for some con.
sidetabfe time." . .
We admit there was a rather better feeling in the mar-
ket on Tuesday, but very little business was done, and
in 'no instance, that we ha% e heard of, except an advance
:of three-halfpence per piece, on printed cloth, was there.
any improvement in prices ; in fact, itappears to be the
general impression that we have not yetarrived at the
worst.. However, this is only one opinion set in oppo-
sition to another, and it occurs to us that the commercial
world will not derive any great benefit from either.
We.will not say that, in Issuing such paragraphs as
the ale:Which we have quoted, our contemporary was
-actuaied.by sinister motives—we will not say that they
tatittrinted for. the purpose of seducing people into a
libtiori that the country prospers under the.auspices of a
'Week' and tottering goveruvent ;—but this we will say,
'(and iropf contemporary will give 'his conscience fair
play, hewill ad it the truth of our assertihn,) that the
whole of this great commercial community hare no con-
fidence at all in the present ministry, and that as long as
they remain in edficc me need not expect any improve-
ment in trade.

• ITOUSE OF•COMIMONS.--FRIDAY.
Many petitions were presented on various subjects, and in's
much more orderly manner than has •recently marked this part
of the business of the honse.
The consolidated fund bill, on the motion of Lord Jour;
RUSSELL, was read the second time. -
Col. l'EncnvAt. inquired whether the annual returns regard-
ing committals iu Ireland, which ought to have been presented
in February, were likely to he soon before the house?
Lord MouPETti answered that he would inquire.
Lord STANLEY asked when the registration of voters (Ire.
'land ) bill might be expected to be presented, leave to bring it
in having been given early in March•?
Lord JOHN RUSSELL answered• that the delay bad resulted
from the necessity of considering various points that had arisen,.
tlyit.thev now were settled; and that the bill would'be presented
as soon as the attorney-general for Ireland arrived,
Mr. Hum inquired when the Bank of England question
could be brought forward, but he could not get any very distinct
answer from Lord J. Russell. •

send his letter by parcel. They were all aware that a great,
amount of communication vras carried on between the two towns
in that matter, to the great benefit of the railway; and that, no
donut, explained why they had not received co-operation from
that quarter, for the dir;vtors felt that the postoffice reforin,
which was sought by the meeting,'would occasion a great fulling

The resolution watt then'put and carried-unanimously. ;
Mr. TODD, moved the,,,next .resolution. He said that there'
were sweets -and bitters mingled up in, it. The first'part might
he. considered an unalloyed sweet ; but the last, which had re'
feren,ce to subscriptions, might
,be deemed somewhat bitter.
If the people at large, were indebted to Mr. ;Rowland Hill for
his exposure of the abuses in the postoffiee management, surei

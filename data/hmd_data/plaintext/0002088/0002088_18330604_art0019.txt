NEGRO SLAVERY.

A number of petitions were presented by Earl Grey, Lord
Id, and.the Earl of Roden, praying for the abolition of
slavery in our colonies.

The Duke of WELLINGTON presented a petition from mer-
chants, shipowners, and other inhabitants of the city of Bristol
and its vicinity, against the plan for negro emancipation brought
forward by ministers. The petition stated that immense loss
would accrue to that town should the proposed measure become
law.

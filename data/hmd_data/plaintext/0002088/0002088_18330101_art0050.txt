At our market this morning there was an animate enquiry for really
fine parcels of Wheat, and 7s. 9d. to 7s. 10d. per 701bs. was firmly
demanded for choice samples of red, being an advance of fully 2d. per
bushel since this day sen'ulght. Flour has however been dull sale at
a decline of Is. per 2801bs. Fine oats are scarce and prices are well sup-
ported : there has been but a moderate enquiry for Oatmeal, and 245.
3d. per 240 lbs. may be considered the top price for prime qualities,
In Beans there was a steady trade without any alteration in value.

-Iy-square,y-square, was thrown into a state of the greatest alarm about
Ifall-past two on Friday morning, in consequence of the explo-
h„on of one of the enormous gasometers beionging.to the City
London Gas Light Company. The report was like a roar of
,rtillery. The gasometers of this company arc the largest in
i!'ondon ; they are built closely together, and from 10 to 12 in
'Ztdriber; and had the wind been -high, as on Monday night,
pColiabty the whoie neighbourhood would have been destroyed.
he dames were seen rushing out of the roof of one of the gaso-
keter houses, but the engines, which quickly arrived, were not
tiveered to enter the gates of the works. Since the death of Sir
Warn Congreve no government inspector has been appointed

EIRE-RAISING.—George Wren was indicted for
Poniously setting fire to a haystack, the property of Eleanor
wqller, on the Stu of November, at Ucktietti. The prisoner

ru ate about the poor-house, and within
tight of it. It was in the centre of a grass field. On the night
!raed, the prisoner was at a beer-house with a lad named So-
,r, about six o'ciock. He asked him for some touch-paper,
bqich having received, he threw it into the fire : it did not burn
liN'y well. He asked Soper for some snore, as he wanted to
itht his pipe with it. Soper gave him eight or ten pieces more,
kild the prisoner went away. He was afterwards met smoking
yipe, and going in a direction that would lead to the stack.
Ow rods below the stack footsteps were discovered leading
Or a gap across a lane into some waste ground, which led into

„7 footmarks they were found exactly to correspond. Some
aer circumstantial evidence being given, he was found guilty.
tt-Pn Thursday the wretched young man was brought up to le-
ttive judgment, after all the other prisoners had been orsposet:
jHe is only nineteen years of age, slight and rather deli-

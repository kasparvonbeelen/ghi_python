CONTEMPORARY PRESS.

The annihilation of the Whigs, as a party, is at hand
—and their toady during the period of their ascendancy
—the Times—is launching at the Conservatives, what
people have learned to laugh at, under the title of
its thunderbolts. Yes :—the property-man in Printing.
House-square is putting in requisition all the appliances
of theatrical thunder—but no illusion is excited by the
storm-scene. The spectators laugh at these laborious
and mechanical efforts to frighten and excite them—and
the movers of the childish machinery have their. labour
for their reward.

The truth is—and the Times is beginning to find it
out—the people of England will never again place con-
fidence in the " leading Journal." The Times has be-
trayed every cause which it has esponstd—every party
which has trusted it. The Times has, on a thousand
different occasions, led those who were swayed by its
suggestions into false and dangerous positions—and
then with a baseness to which there are few parallels in
political history, immediately denounced, and invoked
vengeance on the victims of the courses which itself had
recommended. The Times, we repeat, has done so on
a thousand occasions—but we are greatly deceived if
our contemporary will ever again have an opportunity
of repeating its atrocities of that description.
Well, the Times tells its readers that the Whigs are
in a sorry plight—and therefore it would have its readers
believe the world is coming to an end. The Whigs
do not stand high in. the estimation of any portion of
their countrythe.n—and we incline to think that the ad-
vocacy of the Times will not lessen the odium which at-
taches to all their recent movements.

The Whigs, in the early period of their brief. tenure
of office, were trusted and supported by the people, as
never Ministry was trusted and supported before. They
have deserted and betrayed the cause which they bad in
the most sacred manner pledged themselves to ad-
vance:—they have truckled to the oligarchy, which they
were employed to humble :—they have treated with
contempt the prayers of those to whom they owe that
power which they prize more highly than honour, or
self-respect. They have, in short, done all that men of
honesty or decent pride would have scorned to do—and
they have done all in vain. They have lost, beyond the
possibility of redemption, the favourable opinion of the
great body of the community—and they have failed to
propitiate the people's implacable enemies. The Whigs
trave, in the most abject style, offered, on condition of
being allowed to remain in office, to do for the Tories
all that the Tories could desire to see done—and the
Tories have spurned the offer. The Whigs can fall no
lower. Annihilation must be the object of their anxious
prayers.—The True Sun.

The news of the disastrous capture of the greater part
of the fleet of Don Miguel by Captain Napier will be
read with painful interest by all those who, like ourselves,
can separate sound principle from the unhappy person
most unfortunately from circumstances allied and bound
up with it. The event is the more to be lamented as of-
fering a premium upon intrigue and treason, for, from
the relation of Napier himself, it is sufficiently clear that
the victory was about as bloodless as the vanquished were
cowardly and treacherous. Amongst the few killed and
wounded it is grievous to find that English blood has
alone been shed, whilst it is a praiseworthy redemption
of Portuguese fidelity to find that not 'one single native
arm was raised against the accepted Sovereign of Por-
qugal or bled in the fight against him. The gold of Louis
Philippe has refreshed the drooping laurels of Palmer.
ston, and few will envy the noble lord the glory of having
been the successful pander to the ambitious and merce-
nary speculations of the Palais Royal. For the first time
in the history of England her minister has condescended
to crimp for the foreigner, and has submitted to the ig-
nominy of dispensing foreign gold for English blood.
For the first time, (would we could add the last), the di-
plomacy of the haughty and honourable islander has be-
come the obsequious and cringing agency of Gallic bri-
bery, and has succeeded in annihilating with golden ar-
gument the fidelity which was proof against the sword.
Those shores which have heretofore resounded with the
glories and achievements of Britons in the open and deadly
conflict, have now been for ever disgraced with the tri-
umphs of a British officer, prepared by French money and
consummated by Portuguese perfidy. Cannon without
ball have thundered away in sham fight, and gallant men
have rushed on board, meeting death from a faithful few
where they. had anticipated to find traitors all, and a vic-
tory debasing to the victors has crowned premeditated
treason. The gallant spirit of a sailor must repudiate
with shame and detestation any acknowledgments of ho-
nour from an achievement in which the arm of his foe was
palsied and disabled from action, not by the gleaming
steel or the cannon's deadly roar, but by the profusion of
a French exchequer, administered through the folly, the
imbecility, the stupidity, and the madness of Downing-
street.

Little pity have we for Don Miguel in our considera-
tion of the consequences to be apprehended from this fa-
tal occurrence. He who is too cowardly to place himself
in the front of a devoted people, to fight and 'to dare his ;
enemy, is little deserving of empire. Let him flee
far and save himself ignobly from dangers which his pu-
sillanimity has provoked, and the courage of a true Bra-
ganza
would have braved and vanquished. Our cares
are not for him ; our concern is that a sacred principle
should have been identified and disgraced in so unworthy
a representative. Our feeling is for the gallant Lusita-
nian nation of which, instead of being the dastard sove-
reign, he is scarcely worthy to be the trembling slave.—
Persecution, oppression, and slavery are in store for that
people so well deserving a better fate, whilst shame and
indignation swell the breast and redden the cheek that
she may justly charge to the account of England so many
curses and misfortunes. We • say it, and every Portu-
guese feels it, that Portugal never can submit to the
hated
,dornination of Pedro. So that years of civil strife,
devastation, and murder will be the national echo to the
triumphs of the triumvirate of Napier, Orleans, and Pal-
merston. Shades of Vincent and Nelson ! how would ye
start with horror to find the name• of a British sailor
grouped in Stch.a fraternity.
Right heartily we wish the gallant Bourmont a safe
deliverance from the meshes of so much foreign intrigue
and domestic treachery. If it be in the power of man to
stem the tide of such overwhelming disaster, he is that
man ; but disgust and abhorrence may probably induce
him to abandon a cause which, under circumstances of
honourable misfortune, constancy, and courage,•he would
never have despaired of.—Guardian.

There has been lately exhibited in the -palace of the Tamed°,
St. Petersburgh, a state bed, constructed a the Royal manu-
factory, by order of the Emperor, to be sent as a present' to the
Scah of Persia. It is formed of solid crystal, resplendant with
silver ornaments. It is ascended by steps of blue glass, and
has a fountain underneath, so contrived as to throw out on each
side jets of odoriferous.waters. The effect, when the chamber
is lighted up, is absolutely dazzling, as it has the appearance Of
myriads of diamonds.—Galignunes Messenger.

• INDlOO.—The India House Sale has gone very unevenly; we
stated the rise in prices on Tuesday last, since which there has been a
decline of about 6d. cIP lis ; the market has again rallied to nearly, the
opening price.—This day 5,830 chests have passed the sale. The
advance upon the last sale is Is. 10d. 0 29. for ordinary to middling
qualities, and 2s. e 2s. 3d. for good and fine. The Sale will finish
early to morrow.

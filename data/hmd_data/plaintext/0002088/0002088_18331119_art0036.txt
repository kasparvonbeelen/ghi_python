This was an indictment charging the defendant with
having published in the Brighton Guardian, of which he
was editor and proprietor, a libel on the magistrates of
the county of Sussex. The particulars of the indictment
alleged that the libel had a tendency to excite the labouring
classes against the higher classes, to excite them to incen-
diarism, by urging them indirectly to set fire to corn and
hay-ricks, and other agricultural property exposed in
farm. yards—and finally, by charging the magistrates with
partiality and persecution of the peasantry, goading on
the latter to revenge themselves of the former.
An affidavit was put in by the defendant, denying the
intentions attributed to him, and showing that he scarcely
read, and certainly had not published the libel, which had
arrived at a late period preceding the publication of his
paper, with the design which was charged against him
in. the indictment. He also put in about a dozen affida-
vits from as many magistrates of the county of Sussex,
alI favourable to the general principles of his paper ; and
stating their disbelief of the intention imputed to him
in the publication for which he had been convicted.
Mr. Cohen then addressed the Court in person, in mi-
tigation of the offence, to which Mr. Sergeant Spankie
replied on the part of the prosecution.
Mr. Justice Parke, in pronouncing the sentence of the
court, said, that though there might be a reasonable
doubt of the intention of the defendant in publishing the
libel to excite the peasants to arson, there could be none
whatever as to its being a gross and scandalous libel.
The sentence of the court therefore was, that he should
be imprisoned in Essex county jail for six months, pay a
fine of £5O to the King, and find sureties, himself in
.£looand=two in £5O each, for three years; and to be
further imprisoned until the said fine be paid, and the
said securities were found.
The defendant was removed in custody.

Sir James Scarlett applied to the Court for a writ of
habeas corpus to be directed to the Governor of Norwich
gaol, to bring up the body of Mr. Reeves, who is at pre-
sent confined on a charge of felony, and placed under his
(the governor's) custody.
It will be recollected by our readers, that during the
late gales the Earl of Wemyss steam packet was lost off
the coast of Norfolk, and the lives of six ladies were lost,
some of whom had in their possession considerable pro-
perty. Upon the bodies being conveyed ashore, circum-
stances occurred which induced Government to institute
an inquiry, and which terminated by the committal of
Mr. Reeves, on a charge of converting the property be-
longing to Mrs. Pike to his own use. Application was
afterwards made to the magistrates by his friends, to al-
low him to be bailed; the result was unfavourable, and
it-led to the present proceedings.
Sir James Scarlett, in support of the application, read
eAtracts from a great number of affidavits, in which Mr.
Reeves was spoken of in the highest terms, and of his
being innocent of the charges which had been brought
against him.
the learned Judge granted the habeas, when a discus-
sion took place as to when it should be returned. It was

DIVIDENDS.

LE-Ens, Nov. 15.—The woollen cloth trade in Leeds and its
neighbourhood still continues moderately good. There are,
comparatively, few hands unemployed, and the sales in the Cloth
Halls, both on Saturday and Tuesday, indicated a slight im-
provement in the demand.
Bradford Market, on Thursday, was very dull. The manu-
facturers still hold out in consequence of the high price of wool
and the merchant refusing to give the advance. The result is
that in one or two instances the manufacturers have reduced
wages.
ROCIID ALE FLANNEL. MARKET.--This market was brisker
on Monday than it has been for several weeks past. There
was a numerous attendance of both buyers and sellers. Mid-
dle and low kinds of goods sold very freely, and some of fine
qualities fetched better prices.
At HALIFAX MnaKEr on Saturday there was rather less bu-
siness done in stuff goods than there was on the preceding
market day; prices however for both goods and wool remained
firm.
At HUDDERSFIELD MARKET on Tuesday also more business
was done, but there was no material alteration in prices.
At DEWSBURY the flannel trade continues dull, but in many
of the surrounding villages there does not appear to be any
great lack of employment.
LAN:• ISDIRE.—The cotton factories at Royton, Shaw, Old-
ham, and Heywood have nearly commenced working full time,
and there is a better prospect for the cotton trade. The silk-
weaving business, for several miles round Manchester, conti-
nues to he very bad. Above one-half of the hands are out of
employment,

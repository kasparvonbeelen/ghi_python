TO THE EDITOR OF THE LIVERPOOL STANDARD.

St u,-1 perceive that your liberal contemporary, the Mercury,
continues to harp upon the mistake which the Hey. Mr•.
McNeile is alleged to have made in attributing Russell's
Modern Europe to the pen of Lord John Russell.
I did not hear the rev. gentleman on the occasion referred to,
but all accounts agree that he had the book in his hand, and
no account has dared even to insinuate that there was any in-
correctness in his quotation from it. Of what then is he ac-
cused? of ignorance of the author? Even the Mercury will not
allege that the rev, gentleman CANNOT READ; and with the
book in his hand, he had but to turn to the title page, to see the
author's name. IgnOrance of the author, therefore, is out of the
question.
Of what mistake, then, was he guilty ? Of none at all I
should think, for his habitual accuracy, even i❑ the torrent of
his eloquence, is quite astonishing.
It is possiae, certainly, that on the occasion in question, he
might have made a verbal mistake, for the first time in above
three years. I repeat for the first time, because the eagerness
with which his alleged mistake was caught at, and misrepre-
sented, is proof positive that if any similar occasion had been
previously-afforded. it would not have pasSed unnoticed. . •
The week before last, the Mercury threatened some editorial
remarks on Mr. McNeile's letter to Mr. Cropper and Horsfall.
They have not appealed! I strongly suspect that, Mercutius
iii he is, in wit and eloquence, your '•esteemed contemporary"
has found ii a tough jots; and that he most wait for a congenial
thaw—in his own brains—before 4he will timid himself competent
to answer that admirable exposure of the slavery of popery.-4

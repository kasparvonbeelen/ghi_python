HALIFAX.

By the Lady Paget, Capt. Lockett, which arrived at Liver-
pool on Tuesday, we have received Halifax papers of the date
the 21st August. From these we learn, that Sir John Harvey,
on the occasion of his assuming the government was compli-
mented by the mayor and corporation of St. John, with a con-
gratulatory address. In his reply his Excellency avows the
confidence which he reposes in the !ovally of the inhabitants
of the province—a confidence which their conduct during the
recent tieing crisis warrants him to extend.

From these papers we learn that the legislature of Tobago
had determined to abolish slavery in that island on the Ist of
August.

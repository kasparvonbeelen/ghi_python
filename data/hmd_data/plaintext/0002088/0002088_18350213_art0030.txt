FRIDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 13, 1835.

We cannot afford to waste another word about the
speakership further than to announce that the election of
Sir CHARLES MANNERS SUTTON will be carried by a
large majority.

We have received Jamaica papers to the -3d January.
,The Christmas holidays,had passed over in good humour
and harmony, without the slightest attempt being made
to disturb the peace of the colony.. On the 22d Dec.
the House of Assembly was prorogued from that day till
the 27th January. The following is the speech of his
Excellency Lord SLIGO
:
"Gentlemen of the Council,
" Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the Assembly,
"The near approach of the Christmas holidays rendering it.
expedient that you should return to your respective residences_,'
where yonr services, valuable as they ale here, will be so much
nlore im members I have resolved alp releaaing.ou from our
sit:ties sa of tfie legislative body, at:cr au attendance
of unusual duration.
" None of the bills which have been presented to me as the.
result of yoUr labours are of a nature to call for any observatiou
from me, except the special Commission bill; I consider it to be
one of much importance, and though various circumstances
have induced me to resolve, on not•acting under its provisions
In a recent case, I feel the great utility of the measure, and
Bhali not hesitate to, avail myself of it if any occurrence should
unfortunately arise Miele it can with 'impiety be used.
" It affords me much satisfaction to be enabled to inform you
that a second and further increase to the number of special ma-
Ristrates has_ been announced to me by the recently arrived
Packet: several of those appointed for this colony had actually
sailed previous to the date of the despatch which I have received,
and the rest were immediately to follow. When a.l of them
!shall have arrived, I have no hesitation in saying that the num•
bar in the island will be perfectly adequate to its exigences.
I am further gratified at being enabled to inform you that
FR' Plan of the. better arrangement of the West India packets
now in active progress, and I, am instructed to say that it will
be very speedilymatured.
" It remains for me now only to mention, that the rules laid
down for the proceedings under the act of the imperial par:ia-
lnenti for compensating persons having previous rights to the
.tervice of manumised slaves, have been approved of by his
illajesty in. council, with the exception only of tho 13th and
14th, which, being appealed against, still remain under con-
!ideration. That rule which affects the distribution of the-fund
between persons standing towards each other in the relation of
debtor and creditor has not been allowed by his Majesty in coun-
cil; but the confirmation of the rules of proceeding, with the
exceptions I have before mentioned, removes every obstacle to
the active prosecution of their claims, by the different persons
who seek to benefit by the payment of the compensation
money. The promptitude which his Majesty's government
have shown in this respect, and the heavy responsibility in-
curred by the colonial secretary, in snaking, without the sanc-
tion of Parliament, so considerable an increase, as well to the
emoluments as to the number of special magistrates, will, I
trust, be considered to afford abundant proof of the deep in-
terest he takes in common with his colleagues in the welfare
of Jamaica, a responsibility so great as only to. be justified by
the imperious exigencies of the moment. and the injury which
must have inevitably resulted from any. delay in affording such
assistance.
"Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the Assemblyt
"I thank you for the supplies which you have voted for the
services of the current year, and hope that the careful and
anxious superintendence of theieappropriatiou will render them
Fully sufficient for all requisite purposes.
"Gentlemen of the Council,
"Mr. speaker, and Gentlemen of the Assembly,
" haiss made all the arrangements which I think necessary
LaLa provide for any cuntingency which may possibly arise during
approaching holidays. The usual detachments of troops '
are ordered to be sent out. More than the ordinary number of
?lease's of war will proceed. to various parts of the island, with
Instructions to render assistance wherever it may be required.
There will 'be besides other forces kept there in continual readi-
tless in case of any emergency.
"I am happy, however, to feel .myself enabled to stale, that
an the information which I have received affords me the strong-
net graunds..for thinking that. no idea of any discontinuance of
the present tranquillity exists in any quarter; and has con-
7•;iaced me that those preParations which I have nevertheless •
felt it my duty to Make, •mighht, without the slightest danger,
have been dispensed with. I amappy also to add, that alt the
;Ports, public and private, which I have lately received, as to
the general feelings of the apprentices, and their increasing dis-
-1"ilion to undertake the extra labour for the exigencies of the
eolliing season, are most satisfactory.
" I do now in his Majesty's name prorogue this General
kfluctubly until Tuesday, the 27th day of January next, and it
' hereby prorogued according."
Prior to .the prorogation the House had adopted the following
• esultitions:—

'Resolved, nem. con.—,
"'That this house having prolonged their sitting to a most in-
tonvenient period, and done everything in their power to give
'l4iency to the law passed for the abolition of slavery, cannot
" Parate without expressing their surprise and indignation at
t°e abrupt and unsatisfactory answer of the colonial minister
en the 10th of November last, 1,, the just remonstrances of our
?gent, as to the dangerous state in which the island is placed,
°Y the very inefficient measures adopted by his Majesty's
Rovernment to bring to a successful issue the mighty and fright-
-I'4l experiment introduced by his Majesty's advisers."
"Resolved, nem. con.—
"That after a very careful perusal of the correspondence
between our agent and the colonial minister, the house return
Their thanks to William Burge, Esq. for his able, timely, and
disinterested interference for the protection of this island, and
regret that his exertions have met with so little attention, and
a° ungenerous a reception, at the colonial-office."

or a letter dated Port Antonio, 30th December,
IS31—The Christmas passed off very quietly, and all the ap-
prentices in this quarter have returned to their work.

Extract of a letter dated Lucea, Dec. 30, 1831.—" The
Christmas holidays have passed off without the least manifesta-
tion of disquietude. The apprentices enjoyed their usual sport
after divine service on Thursday, and continued their amuse-
ments on Friday<and Saturday. On Sunday it was indeed re-
ally cheering to.see thousands of persons thronging. in well-
dressed parties to the. Church. the Presbyterian Kirk, and the
-ptist Chapel. The Rev. Mr. Watson, the minister of the
irk, availed himself of the oortunity to offer several remarks
pp
touching the condition of the apprentices, and the conduct to be
expected from them. He particularly exhorted them to corn-
l';ence their labour on the morning of the 29th with cheerful
obedience and pointed out the evils that would arise from the
tliallest attempt at insubordination. This gentleman is really
!ndefatigable in the duties of his ministry and it is sincerely to
I') be regretted that the ill-health a his, amiable cimsort will
compel him to leave the island for some months."

Extract of a letter from Say-la-Mar, dated Dec. 30, 1831.--: " The Christmas holidays went off cheerfully. Dancing and

other amusements prevailed throughout the parish; and on
Monday morning the peasantry went to their work in the most
orderly manner. The proprietors and representatives have
continued their usual allowances, which they receive in a proper.
spirit. The mills are all about, and long may continue the ma-
nufacture of our staple sugar.—On Sunday the Established
Church was crowded to excess, the apprent►ces were dressed in
their best attire, and the Rev. Mr. Steward delivered an elo-
quent sermon on the occasion. •

The accounts receind from the country by post yesterday,
were, on the whole highly satisfactory. The apprentices on
nineteen properties have qtkietly returned to their duty. The
Standard says, dissatisfaction had been exhibited by those on
Kensington. lien, in Trelawny, but a letter was yesterday re-
ceived from the Special Justice of that parish, whO' reports that
all was quiet; besides this the editor of the paper states that his
information. was from a negro; setting aside, therefore, the Sti-
pendiary'iletter, the report is not worthy of much. credit. An
anonymous writer, iu the same piiper says, that on King's Val-
ley and other estates.in Westmoreland insubordination has Ma-
nifested itself,. Our advices from Say-la-Mar reach the evening
of the 29th'ultO.,.and are silent on the subject; besides a letter
was receiYediti this city yesterday from a highly respectable
gentleman of Westmoreland, whorso far from alluding to any
disturbancif in his parish, obsiricts, "the holicrays: hive passed
over quietly),,and title apprentices strow'eve'ry disposition to re
sume their wrirli.;:„they:,have behaved better ijiis.Christmas than
I have knoWn their to do for many years pasi."2--Conimercia/
Advertiser, Jan. 2d.

Mr. Brown, the stipendiary magistrate for Ver4,has resigned;
and will shortly depart from the island. Mr. Dawson of this
city, has been appointett stipendiary magistrate for the district of
Minchioneal,, in the room of Mr. Jerdan deceased.—lbid.

It is painful to be obliged to confess, after all the sa-
crifices which have been node by the people of this
country, th!.'t the slave trade is at this moment, under cir_
cumstances of unsurpassed cruelty, carried on to an ex-
tent never before known since the discovery of America.
We have it, on authority which cannot be questioned,
that since, the intentions of the British legislature be-
came known relative to the abolition 'of slavery in the
West Indies, the colonists, of. Spain in Cuba and
Puerto Rico, and of Denmark in St. Thomas, and those
of other foreign, settlements, have embarked in the.
trade.,tof•: transporting slaves from Africa to Cuba
and Puerto Rico, and likewise to Brazil, to an extent
-!which merges into the shade all the exertions and all the.
loudly condemned criminality of the British slave dealers
.in••the worst of times. It is a fac“hat, as soon as the
intentions of parliament .reached Spain, Denmark, and
the West Indies, active measures weretoncocted and car-
ried into effect for the purpose of supplying the diminu-
tion of slave labour in our colonies, by an increase Of
slave labour ,on the fertile shores of Cuba and Puerto
Rico. We are assured, and we call the attention of
Lord ABERDEEN and the Coloniul-office to the fact, that,
in consequence of these concerted measures for this grand
object, no less than twenty-five slave ships, bound for the
•
coast of Africa, sailed in one day from the little island of
St. Thomas. • At the same time the colonial government
of Cuba paSsed certain orders in council holding out the
most tetuptingencouragement in favour of English co-
lonial Panters'in that island, thinking thereby to draw
from us those enterprising persons who have toiled in our
ill-fated'islands, and whose miSfortunes might tempt them
to.seek an- asylum where the remnant of their property
and
.their industry would be more' respected and more
efficiently protected.
The most melancholy fact of all is that, while Great
Britain and her unfortunate settlers in the West Indies
have sacrificed millions of property—after thousands of
families. have been reduced to comparative destitution—
after the widOw's cruise has been exhausted, and the
'bread of .the. orphan dipped in bitterness—challenging, as
it were, the-beneficence of Providence on' the ground of
assumed philanthropy—it is melancholy, we say, to reflect
that all this has been done in order to sharpen the ap-
petite of foreign avarice, revive the horrors of the " middle
passage," and cover the seas with slave ships, bearing
the blood;and bones, and sinews of those unfortunate
beings over whom floods of tears, and torrents of ink,
and waterspouts of poetry have been poured in vain. It

is a well authenticated fact that since the abolition of the
slave trade.by England only one ship in thirty known to
be engaged in the slave trade has been captured by Bri.
tish cruisers. This is proved by the parliamentary re-

turns. The people of this country have been taxed to
the extent of many Millions in order to suppress the traffic;
but they have dime no more than a drop in the ocean
'compared-with the extent of the trade. Fiance has entered
into treaties with us for the purpose of co-operating with
Our cruisers in suppressing _it; but, like all the foreign
engagements' of that wily and heartless nation, they have
secretly countenanced a• trailic,which they have publicly
condemned. It is the, same, With the other powers of
Europe engaged in. it. They profess to respect the prin-
ciples upon which the people of Englaudnct; but they
nevertheleq.g repudiate them in practice, and•violate them
'with imputilty. - •

But if our. Cruisers captured one vessel in:thirty Of the
wholenuMher.employed in the slavetrade, that would be
some consolation. It would be .a. trifling percentage of
drawback from an enormous profit:, Nit tt >e 'proportiOn
of one in thirty has reference only to the nurnkr.of.vei-
sels known to, he' 'engaged in the traffic. 'Thelnatigyer
unknown can only be guessed at ; and we are assured, by
those who have..the best means of information, that for
every one so known and reported, there are three which
escape detection, altogether, even in name, and carry on
a lucrative trade without coming into contact with any of
our cruisers,,aod of whose dealings no trace can be pro-
,
cured.

This then is the serious matter. If we only capture
one slaver in ninety, (fur that is the estimated proportion,)
hoW can it.be said that the slave trade is in a fair way to
be abolished ? And this is not the worst of it. The bene-
volent acts of the British parliament, which have slackened
the activity of slaVe labour in our own colonies, have
given an unfortunate impetus to that of the other nations
engaged in it; and if ninety slavers for one captured was,
before the,..bill :Of 'emancipation passed, the estimated pro-
portion, what must be the state of the trade now, when
Cuba, Puerto Rico, Brazil, and the French islands are
daily increasing the number of their slaves, and manu-
facturing as much sugar as was manufactuted in the
most prosperous times by all the slave colonies of
England?

These are perplexing questions. 'lt is for the philanthro-
pists of England to consider whether they have or have
not caused this increased, this unfortunate traffic in human
beings. We give them, as we have ever done, the credit
of good intenti Ms. They have made war upon the system
at home, and have suppressed it. But have they thereby
advanced the interests of humanity ? Have they conferred
a single benefit upon the African? They have taken the
profit of hissieportation out of our hands,--they have, so
far as England is concerned, made our bands pure—our
seamen do not navigate slave ships—but have they placed
the traffic in `the, hands of more humane or more respon-
sible traders? ,In other words, have they not increased
an evil, by rendering its pursuit more profitable to those
who are more.-barbarous, less regulated by the forms of
naval discipline, •more reckless in their principles, more
abandoned and vicious in their habits, and more likely
to commit deeds of cruelty from the simple circumstance
that they are doing that by stealth which is criminal, and
under risks which involve ruin and a loss of life?

It is with 'great pain that we contend that, the philan-
thropists of England are responsible for the renewed
horrors of the'slave trade, and we see no mode by which
they can vindicate conduct whiCh•• has led to such dis-
astrous results; but that which must operate to the sup-
pression of the traffic as carried on by foreign powers.
In the course of a few weeks, certain papers will be
moved for in the House of Commons, which will bring all
this melancholzbusiness before the, perhaps, astonished
eyes of the public. The colonial office has been supplied
with facts, and they have been treasured up since the
time of Lord STANLEY, who, although he had learntsome -
thing of.the new trade through official sources, expressed
himself confounded at the information he then received
on authority' which he could not fur a single moment
hesitate to believe.• Lord STANLEY will understand who
we rely upon for our information when we call to his re-
collection the circumstance of a petition being presented
to, im in Arabic, presented by a gentleman whose knoW-
ledge of the West Indies is of the first order, who has
lost a competent fortune in the colonies, and which
petition was from certain free Africans, praying to be
sent back to Africa in the condition of slaves, seeing that
as free men
.they had lost caste, and were evidently
docmed to paUperism in the West Indies.

a.
This article is 'already too long, and must therefore
exclude some observations which we intended to offer

upon slavery "in the abstract." These last have, for
many a year, been cant terms with those who, anxious to
conciliate public opinion, have sac' ificed a great priticiple
to expediency. We shall endeavour to place this silly
disguise—this senseless veil—this "abstract slaveiy," in
its true light on an early day. But sufficient for to day
is the evil thereof.

We cannot resist, however, calling public attention to
matters which involve the character, morality, and patrio-
tism of our own community; and we do it under the
force, of feelings. 'which are calculated to lower the
confidence• which• we should be otherwise disposed to
place in men who, exemplary in their professed benevo-
lence, have nevertheless- converted it into a.source
profit under the disguise of disinterested philanthropy.
We reduce the matter to two simple questions, leaving
those who beit can answer them to speak out Or be silent?
just as they please. •
We ask Ist.--Is there a mercantile house in Liverpool
which is in the habit of exporting -British manufactures
to the Danish colony of St. Thomas, or to the coast or
Africa, which manufactures are assorted for and made
directly available in the purchase of slaves

2,1.—1 s there a house in Liverpool which sends the
goods of the quality alluded to, and fOrthe purposes
mentioned, directly to the parties who purchase slaves,
and which house draws for the amount'of goods, as ex-
ported, upon houses in Hamburg and France ?

We have been furnished with documents on this sub-
ject, which are of so painful a nature that, although the
truth of them is unquestionable; we cannot yet bring,
ourselves to the task of publishing them. The truth
however, must come out before long, and-

IO another place, in an Irish law report, the curious
reader will he made acquainted With the' purposes: to
Ala holy Water is applied in Ireland. -Over, the' faces

Much refreshment and consolation from the drolis; but
in the present instance a poor old gentleman of the name
of Macdonald had too Much of the holy water; the mop

whole bodY.d.renched as if St.,,Swithin had had a spite
against him, or as.if he had swam from Scotland to Ire 7
land like St. Patrick, with his head under his arm.
All the parties engaged in this trial are Roman Catho-
lics, and, therefore, we suppose we shall be allowed to
take their evidence without being chargeable with orange
or protestant misrepresentions. The attorney who con-
ducted the case says:— •
" Unhappily the priests of this country—and.l speak it with
deep regret, being myself a Roman Catholic,--are divided into two
classes: one is literally absorbed in the vortex of Political agi-
tation, and, abandoning the peaceful dutieS of their. calling, are
hurried away amid the storm and strife of earthly politics.
When. like Prospero, they should calm the troubled limits that
walk through lam land, they rather stimulate and 'folio() theM
onward in their work! The other class consists of those who,
addicted to low grovelling habits, exercise the most outrageous
tyranny over their flocks in extorting money to enable themselves
to indulge in. their unseemly propensities, so that, when they
should be shepherds caring for their flock, they are no better
than wolves devouring the sheep!'.

After this, let us hear no more of the " slanderi of the
LIVERPOOL STANDARD against the Roman Catholic clergy
of Ireland." Here we have the testimony of yortian Ca-
tholics themselves " Agin their clargy." 'Hare wa have
it confessed, that one portion of the priests.are " ab4orbed
in the vortex of political agitation," and
_that the other
are " addicted to low grovelling habits, and exercise the
most outrageous tyranny over their flocks in EXTORTING
MONEY !" •

Had we said this, we should have been abused from
Martinmas to Midsummer ; but the charge is made by a
Roman Catholic in open court, and no man has dared to
deny it. The facts proved are of the most revolting
kind. An old man, who had contributed his money to
build the chapel, thus desecrated in his own person, is
denounced by the priest from the altar—is insulted and
assaulted by the said Oriest—is dragged out of the chapel
by a hand of infuriated ruffians, and he would in all pro-
bability have been murdered but for the intercession of
his friends. Such is popery in Ireland I
Suelra swede aould not have occurred it:lv:England. In
fact, we are always glad to draw the proper distinction
between the English and the Irish Roman Catholics.
The latter are violent, lawless, and ignorant; the former
are peaceable and well disposed. We should not be op-
posed to popery on political grounds, if its professors
were faithful subjects of the King, and men whe 'feared
God after the custom of their fathers, respecting the laws,

he restraints of subordination, and the maxims of chris.

tianity. But we oppose. Irish popery because •it is
rebellion and fraud—because it leads to gross demoraliza-

Lion, and encourages outrage and crime. Reader, judge
for yourself.

We refer our readers to an advertisement in this day's
STANDARD, from the master coachmakers of this town,
and we earnestly recommend to their serious.attention

the letters appended to it. We can assure them that.
they are genuine documents ; they speak for themselves,
and therefore require no lengthened arguments to prove'
that an organised conspiracy is inexistence; which, ifthe:
law be not sufficiently powerful, must be exterminated.,
by more efficient laws, unless we •are prepared-to place
master manufacturers, generally, under the tyrannical and-
arbitrary controul of their labourers.

The journeyman coachmakers, in theircontroversy with
their masters, asserted that they had no connexion with
any. society which, had not been in ex;sterice for more
thaii thirty years. To prove. the contrary, we copy the
following certificate' of an admission to a society in this
town. Iris a copperplate engraved impression, headed—
" LANCASHIRE UNION,

" ESTABLISHED 1832."

And followed by an emblazoned copy of the coachmakers'
arms, with the motto of "Surgit-post-nubia Phcebus."

By the arbitrary rules of thiw.unioiyno man is permit-
ted to work who is not one of that body.. Intiinidatipn
by threats, personal, violence, and annoyance of every
possible kind and description, are practised upon all who

have the courage to attempt to procure an existence in-
dependent of the trammels of the union. All appren

tices at the commencement of the last year of their ser-
vitude are also compelled to become Members of the
union, on pain of- being treated as " illegal" men at the
end of that period. These taint and corrupt the minds
of their junior fellow-labourers, and the consequence is,
that the greater part become idle, vicious, and disorderly.
At the present moment several of the coach makers,
apprentices of this town, are in the Kirkdale House
of Correction, from whence, it is to be feared, they will
not emerge with any very great degree of amendment
either in morals or manners.

Such as we have described it is the situation of the
coach building trade in Liverpool, at this time, and we
trust we have said enough to induce the gentlemen con-
nected with the other manufacttiring trades to make cow-
mon cause with the master coach Mak,ers. . We should
recommend an immediate application to parliament on
the subject.

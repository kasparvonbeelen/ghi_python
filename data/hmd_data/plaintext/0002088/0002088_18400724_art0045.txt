temporary reduction of duty on foreign sugars, we do
so without any sacrifice of our opinion as to the pro-
tection which, until an adequate supply of labour is
procured, ought to be given to our own colonies. The
present state of things is to us the strongest argument
that could be used for immediate steps being taken to
supply that free labour which would enable our sugar
colonies to compete with the products of slave labour.
Now, or never, is the time to restore prosperity to the
West Indian colonies, and to preserve the capital of
the planters. We have no doubt that free labour is
cheaper than slave labour; but free labour has not
been fairly tried in the West Indies, or British Guiana.
Mr. Ewart has addressed a letter to the Morning
Chronicle, in which, he " maintains that it is not by
forcing and fostering our exhausted colonies that the
great question of the abolition of slavery in the world

Is to be solved." Exhausted colonies Does Mr.
Evart mean to assert that the British sugar colonies
are exhausted ? Nothing but ignorance and disinge-
nuousness could hazard such an assertion. Is Jamaica,
with its two millions of waste land, an exhausted co-
lony ? Is Trinidad, with its fine black mould and wa-
â€¢ tered savannahs, which Mr. Canning described as
holding out excitements for carrying on the slave-trade
which flesh and blood could not resist, an exhausted

colony

LONDON LATEST NEWS.

Wednesday Evening, Half:past Sevt
We have had, within the last day or two, variou
existing differences in the Administration, and we '
to believe these are well founded. Considerable

opinion, even upon the coercion measure now passe
parliament, is said to have been displayed in the 0
also upon the West India question. Some idea of
Lion of Earl Grey is understood to have been more
entertained, and of the calling of the Duke of
power ; but this latter, according to rumour, has
doned. This fact we are assured of, that the Admi,
far from united, and that it cannot long, in its pre
remain in power. With regard to the West Indi
nothing of any great moment has transpired. The
of the West Indian body have sent in, to Lord God,
reply to certain measures propounded to them di
recent interview with his Lordship. Up to the pres(
we believe that no actual plan, with regard to Sla.
pation, has been formed, and that at the recent intern"
the deputation, Lord Goderich entered into no detail
pressed himself anxious before he made public any we'
learn the opinions of the leaders of the West India lu'
upon certain portions of what might form such measure.
we believe, has been given in the document sent a day c
p°3l
back to his Lordship from the deputation. Very gt„
crecy has been observed in the business, which has oir'
for a variety of reports respecting the alleged scueo,eat,
may here add a statement current in certain circles, reft4
theimagined project of Government; according to
abolition of slavery is to take place immediately in tfpd
nies. That the slave-owners will be compensated at a
per head for every slave. A loan to be raised to ena
b i 4
compensation to be made, the loan to be redeemed
years. The manumitted slaves to be compelled by the et
trates to work five days out of the seven previous to the. 01
and six days in crop. That two days' amount of wag,e,',6
be deducted and paid into the compensation fund, it bel
sidered that the remaining four or three days, as the cfaclO'
be, will be sufficient for the support of, the negro. It ''tiA
that the West India body are not so averse as it wa',,ASS
they would have been to this plan, but that their chic' ife
is with respect t 9 the amount of compensation. We g'`
matter just as we have heard it. ab

The Spanish Consul General here has this day ma ter,

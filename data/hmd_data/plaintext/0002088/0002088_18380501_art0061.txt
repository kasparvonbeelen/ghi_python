Intelligence.

FRI? AY, APRIL rt.—Wind N.N.E.—Moderate.

Mr. ADAM HODGSON rose to move the third resolution-
He believed that most of the gentlemen who came there came
with the belief that the subject was so well understood, and
the mind of the public so fully made up, that nothing more
was to be said ; ,and all that remained for the speakers into
whose hands the retolutions were put, was to read them.
But a gentleman on his left hand. bad just.observed to him that
no information _had been given to the meeting directly bear-
ing ,00 the. subject of this resolution., He (M. H.) was sorry
,be was not in a condition to give it, but some information was
just, given in evidence before a eummittee of the House of
Commons, wad extracts Mom the. evidence be would now read.
,The first.point was to.the number of letters now sent otherwise
than by post. That they all knew was considerable, but for.his
bert he bad, until ha toad this evidence, no conception, and he
lieved few who beard him said that the practice of evading the
law was &o general and systematic, as it was now proved to be.
[Mr. HODGsom here read several extracts from the evidence
given before the committee, tending to show the extent to which
evasion was carried.] Though he (Mr. H.) knew from his own
observation that the evasion was extensive, hi+ had no idea that
it wai so very extensive until he ,read this evidence. He thought
he was fully entitled to conclude that the revenue of the post-
office would be as extensive by the carrying letters at a penny
,as at sixpence, to say nothing of the stimulus afforded to cum-
Pm.ce, nut he by no means regarded the question as exclu-
sively commercial. tie regarded it• as much noire important in
its social relations, as affecting the intercourse between different
members, of the same families, and especially ,of the poorer
classes, as alluded to by Mr.- Brown. NI r..1-lilfbad proved that
the. ceet of-the mere conveyance of letters from place to place
did not exceed one thirty-sixth of a-penny each, on the average
of the whole. The mere eouveyance of the:letlers cost nothing
but this small-fraction of a penny. The principal expense.was
irs the pbstoffice itself. He appealed to them. if it was right:that
in this„.c.ountryta poor hand-loom weaver, for, instance,
conveyave of_ his letter only cost one thirty-sixth part of a
penny, should pay the priCe of a whole 'day's labour before he
was allowed to communicate with his child. (Cheers. Was it
right that the moment the child left him he should become
estranged from his parents, all communication breken,-and in-
tercourse of feeling interrupted ? Was it right that this domes-
tic affections should be allowed to expire, and his dearest and
holiest associations forgotten for want of intercourse with those
with whom they were. shared ? This was no supposititious case
which he was putting. On this part of the question he knew
front his own observation how -often the poor classes were de-
barred from hearing from their friends; how anxiously they looked
for a private conveyance, often keeping.their letters for weeks,
because they could not bear the heavy tax levied on their slen-
der means by the present rate of postage. The question, he
repeated, was far more important in its social than in its fiscal
relations—far more important to the poor man than even to
the manufacturer or merchant, important as it was to them.
(Cheers.). The third past of the resolutitin needed little corn-
' merit from him If they wished to. raise the moral feeling of the
community, thy should begin by-instilling a reverence for the
"law. No one ccaild break the law without a sacrifice of moral
feeling, and who. could be worse than "to break (belay, syste-
matically, and without even a consciousness or.moral wrong ?
Viewed in its right light there was no difference in moral guilt
between defrauding the revenue in the transmission of a letter,
or by.smuggling. He thought nothing could be more injurious
' moral tone of society than alaw 'which ensured its own
- habitual infraction, and shi-i-uld conclude by adding that' the
motion had his hearty concurrence.

THE STATE OF TRADE v. THE NEWSPAPER
ACCOUNTS.

( From the Manchester Courier.)
For several months it was our practice to insert weekly
accounts of the state of trade in Manchester, which, it is
unnecessary to explain, we gleaned from various parties
On change." The general dissatisfaction, however,
xpreased both by merchants and manufacturers, together
with the conviction that such notices—conveying, as
they did, the feelings and opinions (in some instances,
no doubt, biassed by circumstances) of a few individuals,
,thast be injurious to trade, at length induced us to with-
draw.them entirely from our columns. And it is obvi-
-vas that unless a chamber, composed of -merchants and
)-tistranfacturers, were. established, • tire sense of which
'-shouldbeperiodically taken knit given to the public, a
.tine and exact representation of -the state of trade must
be quite. impracticable. •
,Webave been led to these observations by the perusal
of the following paragraph, whicluappeated in the Guar-
dian of Wednesday :
" Tfiete was edecided appearance of improvement in' our
Market i'esterday.
,The demand for yarnM, and for moit des-
criptions of printing cloths, was better than for some weeks
past; and 'a trifling advance on previous rates was, in some
'eases, realised. The general opinion' appeared to be, 'that prices

much Mote .healthy feeling than basprevailed for suite con-

We admit there was a rather better feeling in the mar-
nt. On Tiiesday, but, very little busibess was done,. and
no instance, that we have heard of, exceptan advanee
of three-halfpence per piece on printed cloth, was- there

(and if: our contemporary will give his conscience-fair

Liverpool, April It, 1838. ' . ,

Sir 11,6iEtur INGLIS gave notice that on the 10th May he
would bring forward a motion on the subject of foreign slaver•.
Mr. (YCoNriELL pospoued his motion on the subject of
slavery in consequence of the absence of Mr. Baring.
A discussion ensued on the mode of proceeding with the
business of the house, when Lord JOHN Russia'. moved that
from and after the 14th May the orders of the day should have
precedence on Thursdays ; but ultimately the noble 'lord with.
drew his motion.

Lord Joust. REssm.t. obtained leave to bring in a bill for the
better regulation of prisons in England and Wales, and also a
bill for establishing a prison for young offenders.
On the motion of Sir R. PEEL, a select 'Committee was ap-
pointed to consider the law 'and practice relating to the entering
into recognizances and the judgment of Costs 111 the matter of
election petitions, and to report their obserVations thereupon to
the hOuse.
On the motion of Mr. SHAW LEFEVRE., a select cotnmittee
was appointed " to consider the standing orders of the House of
Commons relating to private bi:ls, and to compare them with
those of the House of Loris, with the view of assimilating as
moat as possible the standing orders of both houses."
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER proposed that a select
committee be appointed to enquire into the operation of the
acts permitting the establishment of joint-stock banks in Eng-
land and Ireland, and whether it was expedient to make any
amendment in the provisions of those acts,, which was agreed
to.—lt was understood that the members of the committee
would be named on Friday.
Mr. WA RD obtained leave to bring in a bill for the better re-
gulation of the metropolitan sewers.
On' the motion of Mr. DILLoN BnowNE, the evidence taken
before the Kinsale election cOnimittee was ordered to be printed.

PANORIN c, Coog-svrtEET.—Mr. Laidlaw has announced
hii departure from Liverpool on the sth instant. We are satis-
fied that all who have visited this delightful exhibition will
mordially welcome his return. To those who have hitherto post-
poned their visit, we would earnestly recommend an inspection
of this splended work of art. The associations connected with
this exhibition are of the most powerful interest, and equally.
pleasing as a study as gratifying to the eye.
LIVER THEATRE.—Th4 most polite and attentive of all box-
- book-keepers, %l r. Fogg, takes his benefit at the Liver on Fri-,
;day evening nest. The attractive billet entertainments be has
pot forth, ewipled with the fact that the house closes on the
.occasion for the r,aion, will. we have no sloul,t, ensure him a
very crowded auditory. The frequelitters of the Liver must not
forget Air. Fog& ; although he has not afforded them amusement
on the.stagi,
stage, he has contributed not a little to their comforts in
front of it, by his Unremitting attention and civility.

Mr. ~SsiPLE'seconded the resolution •
The cHstasrAN-Observed, before pu gto the vote, that he
was sure. that in the correspondence between Livetpool and
Mnviclsester, the poStotfce, instead of being the cheapest and
'quickest, was the dearest and slowest. If any person in Liver-
-pool wanted to communicate quickly with Manchester, he would
send' his letter by parcel. They were all aware that a great
amount of communication was carried on between the two towns
in that matter, to the great benefit of the railway; and that, no
Voitht, explaiued why they had not received co-operation from
that quarter, for the directors felt that the postoffice reform,
which was•sought by, the meeting', would occasion a grdaf falling
off' in their revenue. . .
The resolution was then put and carried unaniinottsly.

Mr. Ton .moved the .next resoltition. He said -that there
were sweets and. bitters mingled up in it. The first part might
be considered an unalloyed. sweet ;• but the. lail, which had re-
fer,ence to subscriptions, -.might be. deemed. somewhat bitter.

with it not generally .g,noWn• Hill. in hispamphlet,,had
shown, like-pi udiciAs.reforreer, not only where.deTects existed
but he, bad pointed out remedies. He had shown, in the first
place, that while the, revenue in other .4ep,itrimants had .been
increasing,: that, derived from the postoffiee, hail heen retrogra-
ding, during, the lasittwenty.,years, in a trifling degree. He
had shoWn that, bad it kept pace with the, increase in other
hratickei, the income vielded, by it would exceed the present
amount by about £2,000,000. sterling... His reference must be
considereda correct one, because it was drawn from a compari-
son between the politoffice and publk conveyances, and nothing
could be fairer thap. that. Mr. Hill had also shown that in
France, which was. not., so corninercial a country as our own,
there' had heen an increase„gf,s4, per cent. in the postoffice re
venues during the ,last fourteen years; and, if taken. in con-
junction with the actual diminution in England, did not that
fact show that,there was something radically wrong in our sys—
lOrtfk Then the, unequal rake of the tax was a ,thing which
'ought to be conaidered ;,.but, without entering largely into that`
question, snisp.-:e it to say that Mr. Hill deseried their cordial
thanks for having directed the attention of the country to; the
whOle snhjet:t ; and to more that vote having been the principal'
caiie of his rising, he. should enlarge no: more, but leave-the.
subject in their hands.

On the notion of Lord Jo;;;li.ussEl..l,ihe clergy residence
bill was read a third time and passed.
The house then adjourned at half-put nine o'clock.

HOUSE OF LORDS.--FaiDAT.

The-House of Lords re-assembled this evening.
The Earl
..of WINcHILsEA inquired whether there was any
truth in the rumour that Mr. Turton had been appointed Lord
Du rhanes " legal adviser ?"
Lord MELBOURNE answered that no such appointment had
taken place, adding' that, upon further consideration, it was
thought that any appointment of the kind would be ,unnecessary.
The Marquis of LaNsnowNE presented the first report of the
commissioners appointed to visit the Aberdeen Colleges.
Lord MELBOURNE, in answer to inquiry from the Earl of
Aberdeen, said he did not expect that any measure would be
proposed this session founded on such report.
The Marquis of L ANsnowNE (after many petitions had been
presented regarding the Poor Law Amendment Act, National
Education (Ireland), &c.) gave notice that on Tuesday next
he would move the second reading of the Custody of Insane
Persons (Ireland) Bill; after. which .their lordships adjourned
till Monday.

Amitytto.—Franklin, Pendleton, from New York; sailed 25th
March—Nlargaretha, Bompurd, from Groningen—St. Cloud, Coul-
ourn, and Columbus, Coffin, from New Orleans.
SAlLED.—Carroll of Carrollton, Bird. for. New York—Creole,
Tracey, and Samuel it John, Perkins, for New Orleans—Stirling, Stin-
son, for Savannah—York, Meyer, for Lintin—Falmouth, Merrill, and
Hebrew, Carr, for Cadiz—and Manchester, Roddock, for Harnbro'.

LIVERPOOL CORN EXCHANGE, APRIL 28.
• The imports of Flour and Oatmeal, during the last seven days, are
to a' moderate amount those of Grain light. The improved tone
noted in our Wheat market, at the close of last' 'week, has beenfol-
lowed by a better trade generally. with an advance of fully 2d per
bushel in prices ; several parcels were yesterday taken for the inte-
rior of the country, and 8s 10d.to 95 per 701bs paid for fine samples of
Irish red.—Rather higher prices were also demanded, for F10.1.1r. The
business in Oats has been of a very limited nature, and we can make
little change from our last quotation for them ; geod mealing qualities
are held at 3s 2d per 451138.—0 f Oatmeal, whidh has been offering
comparatively cheaper than Oats. and has; consequently, bad the
preference. several large,parceis have been taken, as well by the trade,
as to hold over : 25s 3(1 to 'l,s 9d per 701hs have been the current rates
for Irish manufacture.—The market has continued bare of malting
Barley: prices' nominally as last quoted. No change as regards
Beans or Peas.—Tht.re have been inquires for Bonded Wheat. but
without leading to business; there are few if any sellers at present
rates.

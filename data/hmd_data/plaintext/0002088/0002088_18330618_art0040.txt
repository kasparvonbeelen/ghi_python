THE LATE GALES.

The wind blew so tremendously, on Tuesday, that the Bris-
tol and Newport steam-packets, after two attempts, could not
succeed in making the passage from Bristol to Newport, and
were obliged to put back. The packet cane in ou Wednesday,
having experienced a severe passage.
SIIIPWRLCK WITH Loss OF LIVES.—We lament to state that
on Tuesday last, between twelve and two o'clock, in a heavy
gale of wind, the sloop Edward of Bristol, from this port, with
50 tons of coal on board, three seamen, brothers, named Weeks,
and a passenger (name unknown), gut on shore on the eastern
point of Newport river, where she was completely wrecked,
and all on board perished! The following. day the body of
one of the men (Henry Weeks) was found not far from the
wreck. On the inquest, no evidence was elicited how the ves-
sel was lost; and the verdict returned was Drowned.—illerihyr

POULTON, I?ItIDAY.—This place and neighbourhood was vi-
sited by one of the most severe storms ever witnessed on a Bri-
tish coast, on Tuesday and Wednesday last. The wind was in
a westerly direction, and it blew a complete hurricane—every
thing gave way to its fury; the havoc and destruction com-
mitted on the houses, trees, and fields is immense in this part of
the country, for never before was such destruction ever wit-
nessed in the month of June. The ocean presented one con-
tinued scene of magnificence and terror; and it is to be feared
that the entire crew of one ill-fated vessel has become the victim.
of its fury. This vessel was seen standing for Wyre, but. be-
fore it had made its entrance it was observed to suddenly dis-
appear, and all on board, it is awfully conjectured, perished.
We are happy to observe that in the case of the other vessels it
has been attended without loss of hie, with the exception of ono
poor mau who met with a watery grave and has since been

washed up at Lytham. The shore on Wednesday presented a.
pitiable scene; scattered portions of the unhappy vessels coin-

" Donaghadee, Andrew Smirk," has been washed up, the crew
of which vessel are supposed to have met with a watery grave.
A vessel sunk off the Knot-end; crew drowned. But the most
surprising event ever heard of on these shores remains yet to be
told. About four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, during the
midst of the storm, when it was expected that a boat could not
live for a single moment, a boat was observed making for the
shore, manned by two men, and though the breakers were run-
ning very high, miraculously landed, and the men escaped with
their lives.
On Tuesday, a party of two men, Mr. John Thompson, jud.
of Stalmine, and a Thomas Curran, shoemaker, of the same
place, set out from the Knott End in an open boat, intending
to go over to Peel, a distance of about 15 miles; but no intelli-
gence has been since beard of them, excepting that their boat
has been washed up at Heysham, near Lancaster, and they

o'clock, the time when our account. lett Poulton. The rain.

under water. The damage dOne by the storm in the fields and
gardens is immense, but the former in particular ; the wheat has
suffered in great measure, the greater part of the ears of which
are entirely beaten off, but whether the crops have suffered
more inlaild we have not been able to learn, as we are now
speaking of those lands annaiximating the coast. Durint, the
violence of the gale two houses were blown down at South
Shore, near Blackpool, besides other damage of minor import-
ance in that neighbourhood. Several boats from Blackpool
have been out to reconnoitre, since writing the above, and by
the account given, several more wrecks are on the coast, as they
passed mane that were sunk. It is expected that a great many
of the dead bodies of the sufferers wit! be washed up in a few
days.
LANCASTER, JIVE 14.—The gale on Tuesday blew down
several trees in this neighbourhood, and did considerable
damage on the coast; there is a Dutch vessel, called the Norge,
wrecked at Heysham, and no hands on board of her; two men
were drowned yesterday, returning from the wreck, by their
boat upsetting. It is said that tau or three bodies have been
washed on shore.—!'resters

THE COUNTRY BANKLRS.—A correspondent assures us that

At nineteen he was sent to St. John's, Cambridge • his name
was among the Triposes in 1758, among others Beacion,
afterwards- Master of Jesus Colleee, and Bishop of Bath and
Wells. Soon after this period, Faille, either piessed by cir-
cumstances, or led by caprice, became usher in a school kept
by one Jennings at Blackheath. But this life he found too
irksome, and at the request of his father, 14ho seems to have
been an honest and decent man, he took deacon's orders, and
served a curacy in Kent, where he got the ague. He now gave
up. the curacy, and began to think of another profession more
suited to his restless and ambitious mind. He entered his
name at the Inner Temple in 1;56, and there became acquainted
with Dunning and Kenyon, two men who had a considerable
influence on his future career. The three fellow-students as-
sociated much together, and Horne might be presumed to have
the advantage of his companions, froni his having been edu-
cated at the two principal schools of England, and being a gra-
duate of one of her proudest colleges, while Dunning and Ken-
yon were the pupils of nameless provincial schools, and were
never at college; yet Dunning rose to the first rank as coun-
sel, and to the Peerage, and Kenyon died Chief Justice of the
King's Bench. At the time of their intimacy with Horne, the
three were ludicrously poor. They diced often, during the va-
cation, at a little eating-house near Chancery-lane, where, he
afterwards used to tell, "Dunning and myself were generous,
for we gave the girl who waited on us a penny a-piece; but
Kenvon, who always knew the value of money, sometimes re-
warded her with a halfpenny, and sometimes with a promise."
But he was not destined to make the experiment of this pre-
carious, though tempting profession. His father was
,unluckily
determined to see him a churchman. In 17GU he took priest's
orders, and soon after was inducted into the living of New
Brentford, purchased by his father. Its value, between two
and three hundred pounds a-year, was a sufficient income at
the time, and this income he enjoyed for eleven years. During
one or two of the earlier years of this period he travelled as
tutor with a son of Elwes, the well-known miser. His conduct
in his living was not indecorous. He probably had no great
liking for the simple duties of a station so opposed to his eager,
jealous, and restless temper; but the world was quiet, public
affairs seemed beyond his reach, and he had not yet acquired
the foolish and culpable habit: of volunteeringvolunteeringon all occasions
of public disturbapahe nee.llt has been a subsequent matter of
wonder, that he was, during this period,.
is, avowedly hostile to
the system and pretensions of Popery, and not less to the dis-
senters. But the true solution that the topics were then pro-
fitless, that the laurels of popularity were to be gathered in other
fields, and that his time fur publicity had not yet arrived. lie
had even narrowly escaped being appointed a king's chaplain.
The beginning of the reign of George the Third affords an
admirable lesson of the true spirit of faction. If a patriot ever
sat upon the throne of England, that patriot was George the
Third. Handsome, honourable, virtuous, unwearied in busi-
ness, zealous for his country, and signalizing his first steps to
power by boons to the liberty of the nation, he seemed made
for popularity; it might appear impossible for political viru-
lence to have assailed the King. No public distress gave it an
excuse ; the kingdom had never known such a continuance of
prosperity. No infliction of heaven had subdued her harvests,
no luckless war had embittered the spirit of her people; yet
faction burst out with a fury which might almost prefigure the
violence of the desperate days of France. In the midst of per-
petual additions to the strength of the constitution, the cry was
suddenly raised that the constitution was on the point of ruin.
With opulence pouring on the country from every- quarter of
the globe, the cry was, that the empire was on the brink of
bankruptcy. What was the source of all this frenzy? Lord
Bute was minister, and Wilkes was his enemy. The libeller
began his war, and was checked. The check was sufficient to
canonize him with the ragged patriotism of the suburbs. The
roar was raised round Lord Bute, and from Lord Bute it
reached the throne.
It was in this tempestuous atmosphere that Horne Tooke first_
plumed his political wing. The "injuries" of Wilkes, and
the "tyranny" of Bute, were his theme. His first contribution
iii the cause was a song on the release of the demagogue from
his well-deserved confinement in the Tower. His next effort
was a pamphlet, of such overcharged virulence, that for a long
time he could not find a publisher, even among the tools of fac-
tion, daring enough to print it. It at length appeared, but tin-
der a condition, that if it were prosecuted, the author should
come forward. The author desired little more. It was evident
that the bastard popularity of Wilkes made him unhappy,
roused his rivalry, and determined him to try whether by adopt-
ing his audacity he might not be heir to his fame. This pamph-
let was a piece of vulgar ribaldry on Lords Bute and Mansfield:
it was entitled "The Petition of an Englishman ; with which
are given a copperplate of the 'Croix de S. Pillory,' and a
tine and accurate plan of some part of Kew Garden's." The
pamphlet is addressed "to the right honourable, truly nolle,
and Scottish Lords Mortimer and Jefferies." 'Nothing
can be more trifling and contemptible in point of authorship
than this performance, but its- insolence may be supposed to
have made up for its meagre mediocrity. The two Lords are
supposed to have established a new order in the kingdom, an
orkr of knighthood, of the pillory. " The boon I beg of you,"
taTi, the scribbler, "is to be admitted a knight companion- of

MELANCHOLY CATASTROPHE.--AS Captain Keats, R.N., ne-
phew of Sir Richard Keats,
iGnoliv_eartitito.cromofbe GreenwichyHtospital,
was sailing in an open boat
enly,
on Saturday week, a squall off thest
olaffndshteoorkaphseLredso,
andsu
that before the sheet could be ca
sunk.
There were Mrs. Keats and two of her sisters, Miss Diana and
, Miss Louisa Pitman, and a.boatman, also in the boat. Capt.
Keats instantly laid hold of Miss Louisa, and swam with her a
considerable distance towards the shore, till a preventive ser-
vice boat put off and rescued them both from their perilous si-
tuation, when he learnt the melancholy fact that his wife and
her sister Diana were both lost, together with the boatman.—
The body of Mrs. Keats and that of her sister were found en-
tangled in the gear of the boat, but the boatman has not yet
hoc n found. Both of these ill-fated ladies were young and ac-
complished; they were the daughters of a very wealthy and ac-
tive magistrate of the neighb6urhood, Major Pitman. Mrs.
Keats had not long been married, and her sister was betrothed,
it is understood, to a gentleman to whom she was shortly to
have been united. Captain Keats had Leen on a visit to Sir
John Yarde Buller's, at Lupton. His boat was observed by
the Circe, a yacht belonging to Mr. Wake, of Heavitree, which
was standing across the bay at the time, about half-a-mile sea-
ward of the boat. When the squall came on, the Circe felt its
force and nearly filled, Mr. Wake lulled up and took in a cou-
ple of reefs in his mainsail, and changed his jib; as soon as he
had got all right, he turned round,- and not seeing Captain
Keats's boat, exclaimed to his mama—" Well, I suppose, this has
been too much for the ladies, and so they are gone ashore." Ile
them held on his course, not suspecting that anything had hap-
pened to the boat, which being under the lee cl the iand was in
comparatively smooth water. Had Mr. Wake been at all
aware of the dreadful circumstances, he might, in all probability,
have been instrinnental in saving two, if not the whole of the
unfortunate sufferers.

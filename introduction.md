This will create the online Binder environment. It may take a while when running Binder for the first time but once it is set up, accessing other notebooks will be fast.

Have a coffee if it takes more than a minute.

After Binder is set up you should either see Jupyter Lab interface (if clicked on the binder badge)
 or the notebook.

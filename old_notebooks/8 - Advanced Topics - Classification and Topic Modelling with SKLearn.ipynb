    "Computers find it hard to \"read\" texts. As we've seen in the previous notebooks, transforming a string to a more interpretable sequence of tokens, involved many steps. But it doesn't stop here. So far we focussed on counting words as a way of observing patterns over time. In this Notebook we move the attention from words to whole documents and teach you how text mining helps us working with documents and extract patterns at the level of the collections.\n",

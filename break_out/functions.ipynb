For example ``len`` or ``print``--both followed by paranthesis as you undoubtedly noticed. A function is ``a sequence of statements that performs a computation``, such as counting the number of items in a collection (characters in strings) or printing a string to the screen. So, in general, a function is a piece of code that carries out certain actions, and (in most of the cases) returns a result.\n",

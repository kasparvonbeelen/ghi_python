    "Before we continue, we must first explain to you that the layout of our code is **not optional**. Unlike in other languages, Python does not make use of curly braces to mark the start and end of expressions. The only **delimiter** is a colon (`:`) and the **indentation** of the code. This indentation must be used consistently throughout your code. The convention is to use 4 spaces as indentation. This means that after you have used a colon (such as in our `if` statement) the next line should be indented by four spaces more than the previous line.\n",

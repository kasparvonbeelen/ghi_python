## Part 0: Intro and Setup

Lecture 0: [How to access Notebooks on Binder](introduction.md)

## Part I: Python, the Basics

Lecture 1: [Introduction to the  course](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kasparvonbeelen/ghi_python/main?labpath=1_-_Introduction.ipynb)

We start with a brief introduction to the aims and principles of this course: why should a historian bother to learn a programming language for analysing textual and other types of data? Why Python (notebooks) in particular? We also discuss what to expect from this course (and what not?) and give an overview of the skills you will obtain. 


Lecture 2: [Basic Python, a gentle introduction](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kasparvonbeelen/ghi_python/main?labpath=2_-_Values_and_Variables.ipynb)

This notebook starts with a gentle introduction to the basic elements of the Python syntax. We discuss how to create and manipulate variables, and demonstrate common operations. Some topics are more extensively discussed in 'break out' notebooks or in external documentation.

Lecture 3: [Text and String Methods](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kasparvonbeelen/ghi_python/main?labpath=3_-_Text_and_String_Methods.ipynb)

Finally, we move on from more fundamental syntax to working with actual text data. In this notebook, we introduce 'string methods', which are Python tools for processing and manipulating text files. We also demonstrate how to open and read text files (at scale).

## Part II: Text Processing and Corpus Exploration

Lecture 4: [Processing Texts](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kasparvonbeelen/ghi_python/main?labpath=4_-_Processing_texts.ipynb)

Lecture 5: [Corpus Selection](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kasparvonbeelen/ghi_python/main?labpath=5_-_Corpus_Selection.ipynb)


Lecture 6: [Corpus Exploration](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kasparvonbeelen/ghi_python/main?labpath=6_-_Corpus_Exploration.ipynb)

Lecture 7: [Trends over Time](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kasparvonbeelen/ghi_python/main?labpath=7_-_Trends_over_time.ipynb)


## Part III: Explorative Data Analysis

Lecture 8: [Exploring DataFrames with Pandas (Part I)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kasparvonbeelen/ghi_python/main?labpath=8_-_Data_Exploration_with_Pandas_I.ipynb)

This notebook introduces the Pandas library and explores tools for working programmatically with tabular data in. We have a closer look at realistic and complex metdata derived from the British Library catalogue and demonstrate how you can refine and reorganize information with the goals of studying trends over time.

Lecture 9: [Exploring DataFrames with Pandas (Part II)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kasparvonbeelen/ghi_python/main?labpath=9_-_Data_Exploration_with_Pandas_Part_II.ipynb)

This notebook uses  "synthetic" demographic data about age and gender in late Victorian London. We discuss different types of variables and strategies for visualizing distributions. We proceed with summarising information using descriptive statistics, such as mean and median. From a historical point of view, we investigate whether men are generally younger than women in late-Victorian London.

## Part IV: Hypothesis Testing and Regression Modelling

Lecture 10: [Distributions and Hypothesis Testing](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kasparvonbeelen/ghi_python/main?labpath=10_-_Hypothesis_Testing.ipynb)

In this section, we move from descriptive to inferential statistics. We assess the statistical 'significance' of the gendered differences observed in the previous notebook (on descriptive statistics). We pursue a data-driven and intuitive approach to significance testing. First, We "bootstrap" confidence intervals and then explore permutation for hypothesis testing.

Lecture 11: [Correlation and Linear Regression](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kasparvonbeelen/ghi_python/main?labpath=11_-_Linear_Regression.ipynb)

This session has a closer look at modelling the relation between different variables. The first notebook (click here) discusses how to compute and interpret correlation coefficients and then continue with a gentle introduction to linear regression. The goal is to understand variation in lifespans in late-Victorian London. We try to understand if residents in more affluent boroughs tend to live longer?

Lecture 12: [Generalised Linear Models](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kasparvonbeelen/ghi_python/main?labpath=12_-_Generalised_Linear_Models.ipynb)

The second notebook on linear regression turns to more advanced techniques: Generalised Linear Models (GLMs). We use GLMs to model and predict count outcomes. We explore two case studies in detail: a) gender bias in university applications and b) gender and participation in the British House of Commons.

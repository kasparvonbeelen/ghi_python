    "Welcome to \"Computational Text Analysis for Historians\" a course that will teach you to process, analyse and \"read\" texts using a programming language (as opposed to a Graphical User Interface such as Antconc). In this notebook we give an overview of the course—and detail its \"philosophy\" (or pedagogical principles) as we diverge from the usual coding courses—and why we think a basic code literacy is an import skill for future historians."

    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2. Why this course?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading, writing and adapting code\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course you will slowly become familiar with a programming language called Python (a reference to comedian collective Monty Python (not the snake) which was beloved the creator Guido van Rossum. We tell more about \"Why Python?\" below, but here we wish to explain how we intend to make the first explorations of totally new field more digestible, even pleasurable, for historians.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we have to the common perception that coding is difficult. **It is not**, but it is **different** type of intellectual activity, and generally historians posses less of familiarity with or prerequisite training to master this skill. In this course, we made the decision to show historians how learning Python could be useful to them, in the first instance focussing more on the applications before delving into more intricate matters writing code that is syntactically and semantically correct (we explain later what this means).   \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you learn is to **read** and **adapt** code before we move our attention on independently **write** code. This implies that you shouldn't try to completely understand everything at once, but focus on how changing certain parts of the code affect outcomes, i.e. how this if you add or remove lines in given program. We hope you that reading and adapting code will make you feel comfortable with programming languages, as the perceived difficulties, even anxiousness that students in history often feel when confronted with digital tools is largely a cultural artefact, and artificial. If you can read Foucault, you can read Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons why prioritize adapting code, before we emphasis the skill writing code are the following:\n",
    "- Tradiotionally programming courses (on which we lean heavily of )\n",
    "- We want to demonstrate realistic research scenarios that showcase how code contributes to a rigorous and reproducible way of doing digital history. By initial skipping some of the technical details, we hope that this course allows you to fairly quickly assess how coding and textual analyiss could be useful to your research (maybe you conclude that it isn't, and that is fine of course, but by going through these examples, you will have won a lot of time). The goal is more to help you find your way into new territory, get a basic understanding that helps to you to teach yourself more effectively in the future. Withing the scope of two lessons, one can not become a proficient programmer and digital historian, but one can get a sense of direction and we hope to provide you with the initial tools to grow in future\n",
    "\n",
    "The course is built around a few practical examples, which go from basic (reading and querying corpora) to more advanced topics (classifying document, vector spaces and topic models).\n"

In comparison to low-level programming languages, it may use **natural language elements**, be easier to use, or may **automate** (or even **hide** entirely) significant areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable relative to a lower-level language. The amount of **abstraction** provided defines how \"high-level\" a programming language is.\n",
